Prezados colegas,
Reforçando o e-mail que eu enviei ao Raphael, gostaria que fosse disponibilizado outro executável do jogo tendo em vista que tive o erro demonstrado na imagem em anexo. Realizei a execução nos Windows XP, 7 e 10, todos na plataforma 64 bits.

Raphael,
Tive alguns problemas na execução do jogo. O executável que está no link resulta o erro em anexo. Poderia verificar. Obrigado.

Todavia, não vejo motivos para desconsiderar a postagem pelo fato dela ter sido feita hoje (01 dia de atraso). Naturalmente haverá uma penalização por atraso. Lembre-se ainda que a avaliação é do semestre como um todo, assim, o atraso nesta entrega não será o diferencial na nota final do grupo.
