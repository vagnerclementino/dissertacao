We performed experiments on bug report repositories of bug tracking systems such as bugzilla and debugger. In the proposed approach we apply text mining methodology and TF-IDF on the existing historic bug report database based on the bug s description to predict the nature of the bug and to train a statistical model for manually mislabeled bug reports present in the database. The tool helps in deciding the priorities of the incoming bugs depending on the category of the bugs i.e. whether it is a security bug report or a non-security bug report, using naïve bayes. Our evaluation shows that our tool using TF-IDF is giving better results than the naïve bayes method.","text analysis, Bug, TF-IDF, Naïve Bayes, security bug reports, non-security bug report, mining ","The tool helps in deciding the priorities of the incoming bugs depending on the category of the bugs i.e. whether it is a security bug report or a non-security bug report, using naïve bayes.",Classificador de RM (Scheduler),Keyword-basead,Vector space,With Uncertainty | Probability theories,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

Many software programs rely on bug reports to correct errors in maintenance activities. Bug tracking systems were developed to guide maintenance activities of software developers. However, due to the excessive number of duplicate bug reports, developers spend much time to identify these bug reports. In this study, in order to save developers' time in software maintenance, we propose a bug rule based classification technique to categorize bug reports. By utilizing developer feedback mechanism in the technique, it distinguishes duplicate and valid bug reports and is expected to improve the accuracy of bug reports retrieval. Finally, we show the feasibility of this technique in experiment and case study.","software maintenance, bug report classification, bug tracking system, developer feedback","Classificação de Bugs em duplicados ou não.

Many bug reporters lack the skills, vocabulary, knowledge, or time to efficiently search the issue tracker for similar issues. As a result, issue trackers are often full of duplicate issues and bugs, and bug triaging is time consuming and error prone. Many researchers have approached the bug-deduplication problem using off-the-shelf information-retrieval tools, such as BM25F used by Sun et al. In our work, we extend the state of the art by investigating how contextual information, relying on our prior knowledge of software quality, software architecture, and system-development (LDA) topics, can be exploited to improve bug-deduplication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our contextual bug-deduplication method on the bug repository of the Android ecosystem. Based on this experience, we conclude that researchers should not ignore the context of software engineering when using IR tools for deduplication.","duplicate bug reports; triaging; textual simi-

01/09/2016 20:45:34,sun2010discriminative,A DISCRIMINATIVE MODEL APPROACH FOR ACCURATE DUPLICATE BUG REPORT RETRIEVAL,"

Bug repositories are usually maintained in software projects. Testers or users submit bug reports to identify various issues with systems. Sometimes two or more bug reports correspond to the same defect. To address the problem with duplicate bug reports, a person called a triager needs to manually label these bug reports as duplicates, and link them to their ""master"" reports for subsequent maintenance work. However, in practice there are considerable duplicate bug reports sent daily; requesting triagers to manually label these bugs could be highly time consuming.

To address this issue, recently, several techniques have be proposed using various similarity based metrics to detect candidate duplicate bug reports for manual verification. Automating triaging has been proved challenging as two reports of the same bug could be written in various ways. There is still much room for improvement in terms of accuracy of duplicate detection process. In this paper, we leverage recent advances on using discriminative models for information retrieval to detect duplicate bug reports more accurately. We have validated our approach on three large software bug repositories from Firefox, Eclipse, and OpenOffice. We show that our technique could result in 17--31%, 22--26%, and 35--43% relative improvement over state-of-the-art techniques in OpenOffice, Firefox, and Eclipse datasets respectively using commonly available natural language information only.",Bug-tracing systems; Duplicate bug reports; Triaging Bug; Information retrieval,Removação de bugs duplicados,Classificador da Requsição de Mudança (Maintenance-request manager),Keyword-basead,Vector space,With Learning | SVM,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,
01/09/2016 21:14:16,hosseini2012market,A MARKET-BASED BUG ALLOCATION MECHANISM USING PREDICTIVE BUG LIFETIMES,"Bug assignment in large software projects is typically a time-consuming and tedious task, effective assignment requires that bug triagers hold significant contextual information about both the reported bugs and the pool of available developers. In this paper, we propose an auction-based multiagent mechanism for assigning bugs to developers that is intended to minimize backlogs and overall bug lifetime. In this approach, developers and triagers are both modeled as intelligent software agents working on behalf of individuals in a multiagent environment. Upon receiving a bug report, triager agents auction off the bug and collect the requests. Developer agents compute their bids as a function of the developer's profile, preferences, current schedule of assigned bugs, and estimated time-to-fix of the bug. This value is then sent to the triager agent for the final decision. We use the Eclipse and Firefox bug repositories to validate our approach, our studies suggest that the proposed auction-based multiagent mechanism can improve the bug assignment process compared to currently practised methods. In particular, we found a 16% improvement in the number of fixed bugs compared to the historic data, based on a sample size of 213,000 bug reports over a period of 6 years.","bug repositories, Multiagent system, market mechanism, bug lifetime",Tratar o problema da atribuição de Requisição de Mudançao e Tempo de Resolução da Requisição de Mudança,Triagers,Keyword-basead,Vector space,With Uncertainty | Probability theories,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

The success of these techniques depends largely on the quality of information present in the issue reports. Assigning correct label to issue reports is one of the quality concerns. Previous empirical studies conducted on the issue reports show that most issues are either mislabeled or are not labeled at all. Thus, in order to enhance quality of issue reports, there is a strong need to propose an automated and accurate bug labeling approach. A label can be a bug, feature enhancement or other request. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to label an issue either as bug or other request based on fuzzy set theory. Experiments are conducted on issue repository of three open source software systems: HTTPClient, Jackrabbit and Lucene. We have achieved an accuracy of 87%, 83.5% and 90.8% and F-Measure score of 0.83, 0.79 and 0.84 respectively.

These defects must be fixed and new versions of the software incorporating the patches that solve them must be released. The project manager must schedule a set of error correction tasks with different priorities in order to minimize the time required to accomplish these tasks and guarantee that the more important issues have been fixed. Given the large number of distinct schedules, an automatically tool to find good schedules may be helpful to project managers. This work proposes a method which captures relevant information from bug repositories and submits them to a genetic algorithm to find near optimal bug correction task schedules. We have evaluated the approach using a subset of the Eclipse bug repository and it suggested better schedules than the actual schedules followed by Eclipse developers.","task allocation, Search based software engineering, bug resolution ",Alocação de Tarefas do processo de resolução das Requisições de Mudanças,Líder do Setor de Manutenção (Head of Maintenance),Vector Space,Vector space,With Learning | Genetic algorithms,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,
01/09/2016 22:15:47,chaturvedi2012empirical,AN EMPIRICAL COMPARISON OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN PREDICTING THE BUG SEVERITY OF OPEN AND CLOSED SOURCE PROJECTS,"With the increasing use of software in every sphere of life, it is often found that software does not function properly or some of the functionalities need minor change for improvement. It is becoming very important to record these problems or changes using suitable bug reporting system. A bug or fault is a program defect that is encountered while operating the product either under test or in use. In order to provide the details of bug to the development team, different bug tracking systems are being used by the industry. The bug tracking systems are helpful in bug reporting as well as tracking the progress of bug fixes. Various bug tracking systems have been proposed in the available literature that includes Bugzilla (http://www.mantisbt.org/), etc. Recently, a bug tracking and reliability assessment tool has been proposed (Singh & Chaturvedi, 2011), which helps in tracking the progress of fix as well as reporting the bug. Various parameters are filled up by the tester or user who reports the bug. During bug reporting, different bug attributes namely bug title, short description or summary, detailed description, priority, severity are filled up. The value of severity and priority may not be accurate as far as the submitted report is concerned because users may not have complete information about the modules/ components in which the bug has occurred. Priority of a reported bug represents the urgency of its fix; accordingly a number or level associated with priority has to be assigned. There are five different numbers or levels defined for priority. In addition to the priority, another important parameter that affects the priority of the reported bug is severity. Severity is defined as the impact of bug in working functionality of a component or the system. The impact of the bug varies from user to user. Generally, people do require that their bug must be taken on a priority basis irrespective of the impact on the user or the developer or the system itself. Software projects have clear guidelines on how to assign a severity level to a bug. But, due to non-awareness, people often commit mistakes in assigning the severity level during bug reporting. The severity level can be categorized broadly in five to seven categories. Bug repository of closed source projects of NASA’s PITS (Projects and Issue Tracking System) dataset has five severity levels vary from the fullest to the dullest or from 1 to 5. Bug repositories of open source projects have defined seven severity levels, and these severity levels vary from the blocker, critical, major, enhancement, minor, normal, to trivial or from 1 to 7. Level 1 of severity represents fatal errors and crashes whereas level 5 or 7 of severity mostly represents cosmetic changes such as formatting, alignment, comments and display messages. Other severity levels are assigned for bugs due to addition of new features and enhancement of the existing feature. The default value “Normal” is normally assigned by most of the reporters because they do not analyze the bug seriously. Severity is a critical factor in deciding the priority of a reported bug. The numbers of reported bugs are usually quite high, hence, it is becoming necessary to have a tool/technique which can determine or verify the severity of a reported bug. It is the need of the hour to automate the process of determining the bug severity for the reported bug.

A software project often employs an issue tracking system such as Bugzilla to store and manage their bugs. In the issue tracking system, many bugs are invalid but take unnecessary efforts to identify them. In this paper, we mainly focus on bug fixing rate, i.e., The proportion of the fixed bugs in the reported closed bugs. In particular, we study the characteristics of bug fixing rate and investigate the impact of a reporter's different contribution behaviors to the bug fixing rate. We perform an empirical study on all reported bugs of two large open source software communities Eclipse and Mozilla. We find (1) the bug fixing rates of both projects are not high, (2) there exhibits a negative correlation between a reporter's bug fixing rate and the average time cost to close the bugs he/she reports, (3) the amount of bugs a reporter ever fixed has a strong positive impact on his/her bug fixing rate, (4) reporters' bug fixing rates have no big difference, whether their contribution behaviors concentrate on a few products or across many products, (5) reporters' bug fixing rates tend to increase as time goes on, i.e., Developers become more experienced at reporting bugs.","Bug Reports, Bug Fixing Rate, Empirical Study, Statistical Analysis ",Análise do Taxa de resolução de Requisição de Mudanças.,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Não,Não,Não,O artigo apenas avalia o fenômeno da tempo para corrigir uma Requisição de Mudança

Bug update information managed by bug tracking systems (BTS) is one of text stream data, which continuously generates new data. Therefore, it is difficult for users to watch it all the time. In other words, the task of monitoring stream data inevitably involves breaks of the task, which would lose the context of monitoring. However, to the best of our knowledge, interaction design when involving breaks has not been fully studied yet. The proposed system visualizes the dynamic relationship between bugs with animation, and helps a user grasping the context of monitoring by highlighting updated bugs and the replay of animation for part of the last monitoring time. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated through experiments with test participants. Recent growth of the Web has brought us various kinds of text stream data, such as bulletin board systems (BBS), blogs, and social networking services (SNS). As such data is expected to be important resources for human support robots, this paper would contribute to interaction design of such robots.","bug tracking system, information visualization, monitoring support, stream data visualization ",Exibição do dados das Requsições de Mudança,Todos,N/A,N/A,N/A,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

In particular, a number of recently proposed mining-based software engineering techniques predict bug severity, bug report quality, and bug-fix time, according to this information. Many bug tracking systems provide a field ""severity"" offering options such as ""severe"", ""normal"", and ""minor"", with ""normal"" as the default. However, there is a widespread perception that for many bug reports the label ""normal"" may not reflect the actual severity, because reporters may overlook setting the severity or may not feel confident enough to do so. In many cases, researchers ignore ""normal"" bug reports, and thus overlook a large percentage of the reports provided. On the other hand, treating them all together risks mixing reports that have very diverse properties. In this study, we investigate the extent to which ""normal"" bug reports actually have the ""normal"" severity. We find that many ""normal"" bug reports in practice are not normal. Furthermore, this misclassification can have a significant impact on the accuracy of mining-based tools and studies that rely on bug report severity information.","Bug Severity, Bug Tracking System, Mining Software Repositories","Agrupando Requisição de Mudança anteriormente classificadas como ""normal"" como ""severo""",Gerente de Requisição de Mudança,N/A,N/A,N/A,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Não,"A classificação foi realizada de forma manual, logo nenhuma extensão foi proposta.

Then a mentor, an experienced member of the team, usually teaches the newcomers what they need to complete their tasks. But, to allocate an experienced member of a team to teach a newcomer during a long time is neither always possible nor desirable, because the mentor could be more helpful doing more important tasks. During the development the team interacts with a version control system, bug tracking and mailing lists, and all these tools record data creating the project memory. Recommender systems can use the project memory to help newcomers in some tasks answering their questions, thus in some cases the developers do not need a mentor. In this paper we present Mentor, a recommender system to help newcomers to solve change requests. Mentor uses the Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) algorithm and some heuristics to analyze the change requests, and the version control data, and recommend potentially relevant source code that will help the developer in the change request solution. We did three experiments to compare the PPM algorithm with the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Using PPM we achieved results for recall rate between 37% and 66.8%, and using LSI the results were between 20.3% and 51.6%","information theory, recommender systems, software engineering,software maintenance ",Desenvolvimento de um sistema de recomendação para guia newcomers em sua tarefa de desnvolvimento.,Desenvolvedor,Keyword-basead,Stream of characters,With Uncertainty | Probability theories,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,
08/09/2016 20:05:41,mani2012ausum,AUSUM: APPROACH FOR UNSUPERVISED BUG REPORT SUMMARIZATION,"In most software projects, resolved bugs are archived for future reference. These bug reports contain valuable information on the reported problem, investigation and resolution. When bug triaging, developers look for how similar problems were resolved in the past. Search over bug repository gives the developer a set of recommended bugs to look into. However, the developer still needs to manually peruse the contents of the recommended bugs which might vary in size from a couple of lines to thousands. Automatic summarization of bug reports is one way to reduce the amount of data a developer might need to go through. Prior work has presented learning based approaches for bug summarization. These approaches have the disadvantage of requiring large training set and being biased towards the data on which the model was learnt. In fact, maximum efficacy was reported when the model was trained and tested on bug reports from the same project. In this paper, we present the results of applying four unsupervised summarization techniques for bug summarization. Industrial bug reports typically contain a large amount of noise---email dump, chat transcripts, core-dump---useless sentences from the perspective of summarization. These derail the unsupervised approaches, which are optimized to work on more well-formed documents. We present an approach for noise reduction, which helps to improve the precision of summarization over the base technique (4% to 24% across subjects and base techniques). Importantly, by applying noise reduction, two of the unsupervised techniques became scalable for large sized bug reports.","Unsupervised, Summarization, Bug Report",Sumarização dos dados da RM,"Gerente de Requisição de Mudança, Agendador, Desenvolvedor",Keyword-basead,Vector space,With Uncertainty | Fuzzy set theories,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

Due to this trend, the complexity of these “apps” has been increasing, making development and maintenance challenging. Additionally, current bug tracking systems are not able to effectively support construction of reports with actionable information that directly lead to a bug’s resolution. To address the need for an improved reporting system, we introduce a novel solution, called FUSION, that helps users auto-complete reproduction steps in bug reports for mobile apps. FUSION links user-provided information to program artifacts extracted through static and dynamic analysis performed before testing or release. The approach that FUSION employs is generalizable to other current mobile software platforms, and constitutes a new method by which off-device bug reporting can be conducted for mobile software projects. In a study involving 28 participants we applied FUSION to support the maintenance tasks of reporting and reproducing defects from 15 real-world bugs found in 14 open source Android apps while qualitatively and qualitatively measuring the user experience of the system. Our results demonstrate that FUSION both effectively facilitates reporting and allows for more reliable reproduction of bugs from reports compared to traditional issue tracking systems by presenting more detailed contextual app information.","Bug reports, android, reproduction steps, auto-completion",Auto complementar durante o processo de registro da Requisição de Mudança,Reportador,A feramenta utiliza técnicas de decompilação do código fonte,A feramenta utiliza técnicas de decompilação do código fonte,A feramenta utiliza técnicas de decompilação do código fonte,"Google Code Issue Tracker,",Sim,Não,Sim,

They allow developers, testers and users the ability to report problems associated with the system and track resolution status. Open and democratic reporting tools, however, face one major challenge: users can, and often do, submit reports describing the same problem. Research in duplicate report detection has primarily focused on word frequency based similarity measures paying little regard to the context or structure of the reporting language. Thus, in large repositories, reports describing different issues may be marked as duplicates due to the frequent use of common words. In this paper, we present Factor LCS, a methodology which utilizes common sequence matching for duplicate report detection. We demonstrate the approach by analyzing the complete Fire fox bug repository up until March 2012 as well as a smaller subset of Eclipse dataset from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008.

To improve software quality, developers often allow users to report bugs that they found using a bug tracking system such as Bugzilla. Users would specify among other things, a description of the bug, the component that is affected by the bug, and the severity of the bug. Based on this information, bug triagers would then assign a priority level to the reported bug. As resources are limited, bug reports would be investigated based on their priority levels. This priority assignment process however is a manual one. Could we do better? In this paper, we propose an automated approach based on machine learning that would recommend a priority level based on information available in bug reports. Our approach considers multiple factors, temporal, textual, author, related-report, severity, and product, that potentially affect the priority level of a bug report. These factors are extracted as features which are then used to train a discriminative model via a new classification algorithm that handles ordinal class labels and imbalanced data. Experiments on more than a hundred thousands bug reports from Eclipse show that we can outperform baseline approaches in terms of average F-measure by a relative improvement of up to 209 %.","Bug report management, Priority prediction, Multi-factor analysis",Desenvolvimento de um algoritmo para predição da prioridade utilizando multi-fatores,Agendador,Keyword-basead,Stream of characters,With Logic | Algebra,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

As a step in the bug triaging process, assigning a new bug to the most appropriate developer to fix it, is not only a time-consuming and tedious task. The triager, the person who considers a bug and assigns it to a developer, also needs to be aware of developer activities at different parts of the project. It is clear that only a few developers have this ability to carry out this step of bug triaging. The main goal of this paper is to suggest a new approach to the process of performing automatic bug assignment. The information needed to select the best developers to fix a new bug report is extracted from the version control repository of the project. Unlike all the previous suggested approaches which used Machine Learning and Information Retrieval methods, this research employs the Information Extraction (IE) methods to extract the information from the software repositories. The proposed approach does not use the information of the bug repository to make decisions about bugs in order to obtain better results on projects which do not have many fixed bugs. The aim of this research is to recommend the actual fixers of the bugs.

On a bug report, the component field is used to indicate to which team of developers a bug should be routed. Researchers have shown that incorrect categorization of newly received bug reports to components can cause potential delays in the resolution of bug reports. Approaches have been developed that consider the use of machine learning approaches, specifically Support Vector Machines (svm), to automatically categorize bug reports into the appropriate component to help streamline the process of solving a bug. One drawback of an SVM-based approach is that the results of categorization can be uneven across various components in the system if some components receive less reports than others. In this paper, we consider broadening the consistency of the recommendations produced by an automatic approach by investigating three approaches to automating bug report categorization: an approach similar to previous ones based on an SVM classifier and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency(svm-tf-idf), an approach using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with SVM (svm-lda) and an approach using LDA and Kullback Leibler divergence (lda-kl). We found that lda-kl produced recalls similar to those found previously but with better consistency across all components for which bugs must be categorized.","software bug triage, component recommendation, recommendation system",Triage de bug,Agendador,Keyword-basead,Vector space,With Uncertainty | Probability theories,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

These systems contain different categories of issue reports such as bug, request for improvement (RFE), documentation, refactoring, task etc. While logging issue reports into a tracking system, reporters can indicate the category of the reports. Herzig et al. Recently reported that more than 40% of issue reports are given wrong categories in issue tracking systems. Among issue reports that are marked as bugs, more than 30% of them are not bug reports. The misclassification of issue reports can adversely affects developers as they then need to manually identify the categories of various issue reports. To address this problem, in this paper we propose an automated technique that reclassifies an issue report into an appropriate category. Our approach extracts various feature values from a bug report and predicts if a bug report needs to be reclassified and its reclassified category. We have evaluated our approach to reclassify more than 7,000 bug reports from HTTP Client, Jackrabbit, Lucene-Java, Rhino, and Tomcat 5 into 1 out of 13 categories. Our experiments show that we can achieve a weighted precision, recall, and F1 (F-measure) score in the ranges of 0.58-0.71, 0.61-0.72, and 0.57-0.71 respectively.

In general, bugs are reported in a bug tracking system, validated by a triage team, assigned for someone to fix, and finally verified and closed. However, in some cases bugs have to be reopened. Reopened bugs increase software maintenance cost, cause rework for already busy developers and in some cases even delay the future delivery of a software release. Therefore, a few recent studies focused on studying reopened bugs. However, these prior studies did not achieve high performance (in terms of precision and recall), required manual intervention, and used very simplistic techniques when dealing with this textual data, which leads us to believe that further improvements are possible. In this paper, we propose ReopenPredictor, which is an automatic, high accuracy predictor of reopened bugs. ReopenPredictor uses a number of features, including textual features, to achieve high accuracy prediction of reopened bugs. As part of ReopenPredictor, we propose two algorithms that are used to automatically estimate various thresholds to maximize the prediction performance. To examine the benefits of ReopenPredictor, we perform experiments on three large open source projects—namely Eclipse, Apache HTTP and OpenOffice. Our results show that ReopenPredictor outperforms prior work, achieving a reopened F-measure of 0.744, 0.770, and 0.860 for Eclipse, Apache HTTP and OpenOffice, respectively. These results correspond to an improvement in the reopened F-measure of the method proposed in the prior work by Shihab et al. by 33.33, 12.57 and 3.12 % for Eclipse, Apache HTTP and OpenOffice, respectively.","Reopened bugs, Imbalanced feature selection, Imbalanced learning",Prever bugs que serão reabertos,Analista de Qualidade,Stream of characters,Stream of characters,With Learning | Neural network,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

This question is often among the first few asked by software debuggers when they try to address issues raised by a bug report. Root cause is the erroneous lines of code that cause a chain of erroneous program states eventually leading to the failure. Bug tracking and source control systems only record the symptoms (e.g., bug reports) and treatments of a bug (e.g., committed changes that fix the bug), but not its root cause. Many treatments contain non-essential changes, which are intermingled with root causes. Reverse engineering the root cause of a bug can help to understand why the bug is introduced and help to detect and prevent other bugs of similar causes. The recovered root causes are also better ground truth for bug detection and localization studies. In this work, we propose a combination of machine learning and code analysis techniques to identify root causes from the changes made to fix bugs. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach based on a golden set (i.e., ground truth data) of manually recovered root causes of 200 bug reports from three open source projects. Our approach is able to achieve a precision, recall, and F-measure (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 76.42%, 71.88%, and 74.08% respectively.

projects set up public bug repositories for users all over the world
to report bugs that they have encountered. Recently, researchers
have proposed various information retrieval based approaches to
localizing faults based on bug reports. In these approaches, source
files are processed as single units, where noise in large files may
affect the accuracy of fault localization. Furthermore, bug reports
often  contain  stack-trace  information,  but  existing  approaches
often treat this information as plain text. In this paper, we propose
to  use  segmentation  and  stack-trace  analysis  to  improve  the
performance of bug localization. Specifically, given a bug report,
we divide each source code file into a series of segments and use
the segment most similar to the bug report to represent the file.
We  also  analyze  the  bug  report  to  identify  possible  faulty  files
in a stack trace and favor these files in our retrieval. According
to  our  empirical  results,  our  approach  is  able  to  significantly

Prior work has proposed bug-fix time prediction models that use various bug report attributes (e.g., number of developers who participated in fixing the bug, bug severity, number of patches, bug-opener's reputation) for estimating the time it will take to fix a newly-reported bug. In this paper we take a step towards constructing more accurate and more general bug-fix time prediction models by showing how existing models fail to validate on large projects widely-used in bug studies. In particular, we used multivariate and univariate regression testing to test the prediction significance of existing models on 512,474 bug reports from five open source projects: Eclipse, Chrome and three products from the Mozilla project (Firefox, Seamonkey and Thunderbird). The results of our regression testing indicate that the predictive power of existing models is between 30% and 49% and that there is a need for more independent variables (attributes) when constructing a prediction model. Additionally, we found that, unlike in prior recent studies on commercial software, in the projects we examined there is no correlation between bug-fix likelihood, bug-opener's reputation and the time it takes to fix a bug. These findings indicate three open research problems: (1) assessing whether prioritizing bugs using bug-opener's reputation is beneficial, (2) identifying attributes which are effective in predicting bug-fix time, and (3) constructing bug-fix time prediction models which can be validated on multiple projects.","Bug report triage, issue tracking, statistical model, bug-fix time",In this paper we take a step towards constructing more accurate and more general bug-fix time prediction models by showing how existing models fail to validate on large projects widely-used in bug studies,Agendador,"Keyword-basead, Atributos",Atributos,With Uncertainty | Probability theories,"Bugzilla, Google Code Bug Tracker",Sim,Não,Sim,

Users can report bugs that they encounter in such a system. Whenever a user reports a new bug report, developers need to read the summary and description of the bug report and manually locate the buggy files based on this information. This manual process is often time consuming and tedious. Thus, a number of past studies have proposed bug localization techniques to automatically recover potentially buggy files from bug reports. Unfortunately, none of these techniques are integrated to bug tracking systems and thus it hinders their adoption by practitioners. To help disseminate research in bug localization to practitioners, we develop a tool named BugLocalizer, which is implemented as a Bugzilla extension and builds upon a recently proposed bug localization technique. Our tool extracts texts from summary and description fields of a bug report and source code files. It then computes similarities of the bug report with source code files to find the buggy files. Developers can use our tool online from a Bugzilla web interface by providing a link to a git source code repository and specifying the version of the repository to be analyzed.

In this paper, we propose to consider bugs as first class entities and a useful source of information that can answer such topics. Such analysis is inherently complex, because bugs are intangible, invisible, and difficult to be traced.

Within the bug tracking repository, an activity profile is created for each user from the history of all his activities (i.e. review, assign, and resolve). This profile, to some extent, indicates the user's role, expertise, and involvement in this project. These activities influence and contribute to the identification and ranking of suitable assignees. In order to evaluate our work, we apply it to bug reports of three different projects. Our results indicate that the proposed approach is able to achieve an average hit ratio of 88%.

In this paper, we propose an approach called BUTTER (BUg Triage by topic modeling and heTERogeneous network analysis) to automatically assign bugs to developers. Different from other work, we regard that in most cases, bug resolution is a collaborative activity which involves many developers' participation. Although social network analysis has been introduced to characterize the collaboration of developers, networks constructed by researchers are usually homogenous. That is, all the nodes and links in these networks are regarded as having same properties. Considering developers collaborated on different bugs, we construct a heterogeneous network that includes relationships between submitters, bugs and developers to characterize developers' collaboration. Experiment shows that BUTTER outperforms other methods on automated bug triage."," heterogeneous network, bug triage, topic model ","In this paper, we propose an approach called BUTTER (BUg Triage by topic modeling and heTERogeneous network analysis) to automatically assign bugs to developers.

Triaging bugs can become a laborious task particularly in open source software (OSS) projects with a large base of comparably inexperienced part-time contributors. In this paper, we propose an efficient and practical method to identify valid bug reports which a) refer to an actual software bug, b) are not duplicates and c) contain enough information to be processed right away. Our classification is based on nine measures to quantify the social embeddedness of bug reporters in the collaboration network. We demonstrate its applicability in a case study, using a comprehensive data set of more than 700,000 bug reports obtained from the Bugzilla installation of four major OSS communities, for a period of more than ten years. For those projects that exhibit the lowest fraction of valid bug reports, we find that the bug reporters' position in the collaboration network is a strong indicator for the quality of bug reports. Based on this finding, we develop an automated classification scheme that can easily be integrated into bug tracking platforms and analyze its performance in the considered OSS communities. A support vector machine (SVM) to identify valid bug reports based on the nine measures yields a precision of up to 90.3% with an associated recall of 38.9%. With this, we significantly improve the results obtained in previous case studies for an automated early identification of bugs that are eventually fixed.

As software becomes increasingly important, its quality becomes an increasingly important issue. Therefore, prior work focused on software quality and proposed many prediction models to identify the location of software bugs, to estimate their fixing-time, etc. However, one special type of severe bugs is blocking bugs. Blocking bugs are software bugs that prevent other bugs from being fixed. These blocking bugs may increase maintenance costs, reduce overall quality and delay the release of the software systems. In this paper, we study blocking-bugs in six open source projects and propose a model to predict them. Our goal is to help developers identify these blocking bugs early on. We collect the bug reports from the bug tracking systems of the projects, then we obtain 14 different factors related to, for example, the textual description of the bug, the location the bug is found in and the people involved with the bug. Based on these factors we build decision trees for each project to predict whether a bug will be a blocking bug or not. Then, we analyze these decision trees in order to determine which factors best indicate these blocking bugs. Our results show that our prediction models achieve F-measures of 15-42%, which is a two- to four-fold improvement over the baseline random predictors. We also find that the most important factors in determining blocking bugs are the comment text, comment size, the number of developers in the CC list of the bug report and the reporter's experience. Our analysis shows that our models reduce the median time to identify a blocking bug by 3-18 days.","Process Metrics, Code Metrics, Post-release Defects"," Blocking bugs are software bugs that prevent other bugs from being fixed.

Unfortunately, this information is not usually recorded when fixing bugs, and recovering it later is challenging. Recently, the text approach and the dependence approach have been developed to tackle this problem. Respectively, they examine textual and dependence-related changes that occurred prior to a bug fix. However, only limited evaluation has been carried out, partially because of a lack of available implementations and of datasets linking bugs to origins. To address this, origins of 174 bugs in three projects were manually identified and compared to a simulation of the approaches. Both approaches were partially successful across a variety of bugs – achieving 29–79% precision and 40–70% recall. Results suggested the precise definition of program dependence could affect performance, as could whether the approaches identified a single or multiple origins. Some potential improvements are explored in detail and identify pragmatic strategies for combining techniques along with simple modifications. Even after adopting these improvements, there remain many challenges: large commits, unrelated changes and long periods between origins and fixes all reduce effectiveness.

As a software system grows and becomes more versatile, the number of crashes increases. A large software company receives typically thousands of crashes a day, which make it difficult for software engineers to address these reports in a timely manner. Fortunately, not all reports are new; many of them are duplicates of previously reported crashes. Research has shown that early detection of duplicate reports can reduce the effort and time it takes to handle crash reports. In this paper, we propose a new approach for detecting duplicate crash reports, called CrashAutomata. CrashAutomata builds a model from historical crash reports (more precisely their stack traces) that is used to classify an incoming report. The model is based on varied-length n-grams and automata. Unlike existing techniques, CrashAutomata takes advantage of the generalization aspect of automata, making it possible to build a representative model of crash reports, reducing the number of false positives. When applied to crash reports of the Firefox system, CrashAutomata results in very high precision and recall.

Allowing anyone to contribute finding and reporting faults has an immediate impact on software quality. However, this benefit comes with at least one side-effect. Users often file reports that describe the same fault. This increases the maintainer's triage time, but important information required to fix the fault is likely contributed by different reports. Aim: The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we want to understand the dynamics of bug report filing for a large, long duration open source project, Firefox. Second, we present a new approach that can reduce the number of duplicate reports. Method: The novel element in the proposed approach is the ability to concentrate the search for duplicates on specific portions of the bug repository. Our system can be deployed as a search tool to help reporters query the repository. Results: When tested as a search tool our system is able to detect up to 53% of duplicate reports.

Existing work has studied the social behavior in software repositories. In one of the most important software repositories, a bug repository, developers create and update bug reports to support software development and maintenance. However, no prior work has considered the priorities of developers in bug repositories. In this paper, we address the problem of the developer prioritization, which aims to rank the contributions of developers. We mainly explore two aspects, namely modeling the developer prioritization in a bug repository and assisting predictive tasks with our model. First, we model how to assign the priorities of developers based on a social network technique. Three problems are investigated, including the developer rankings in products, the evolution over time, and the tolerance of noisy comments. Second, we consider leveraging the developer prioritization to improve three predicted tasks in bug repositories, i.e., bug triage, severity identification, and reopened bug prediction. We empirically investigate the performance of our model and its applications in bug repositories of Eclipse and Mozilla. The results indicate that the developer prioritization can provide the knowledge of developer priorities to assist software tasks, especially the task of bug triage","reopened bug prediction, developer prioritization, software evolution, bug triage, severity identification",to rank the contributions of developers,Agendador,N/A,N/A,N/A,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

We collect Mozilla Fire fox open bug repository as the experimental data set and compare different ranking metrics on the performance of recommending capable developers for bugs. Our experimental results demonstrate that, when recommending 10 developers for each one of the 250 testing bugs, DREX has produced better performance than traditional methods with multi-labeled text categorization. The best performance obtained by two metrics as Out-Degree and Frequency, is with recall as 0.6 on average. Moreover, other social network metrics such as Degree and Page Rank have produced comparable performance on developer recommendation as Frequency when used for developer expertise ranking."," Expertise Ranking, Open Bug Repository, Developer Recommendation, KNN Search"," developer recommendation for bug resolution based on K-Nearest-Neighbor search with bug similarity and expertise ranking with various metrics, including simple frequency and social network metrics",Agendador,Degree and Page Rank ,Degree and Page Rank ,Degree and Page Rank ,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

To improve software quality, developers often allow users to report bugs that they found using a bug tracking system such as Bugzilla. Users would specify among other things, a description of the bug, the component that is affected by the bug, and the severity of the bug. Based on this information, bug triagers would then assign a priority level to the reported bug. As resources are limited, bug reports would be investigated based on their priority levels. This priority assignment process however is a manual one. Could we do better? In this paper, we propose an automated approach based on machine learning that would recommend a priority level based on information available in bug reports. Our approach considers multiple factors, temporal, textual, author, related-report, severity, and product, that potentially affect the priority level of a bug report. These factors are extracted as features which are then used to train a discriminative model via a new classification algorithm that handles ordinal class labels and imbalanced data. Experiments on more than a hundred thousands bug reports from Eclipse show that we can outperform baseline approaches in terms of average F-measure by a relative improvement of 58.61%."," Feature extraction, Computer bugs, Training, Linear regression, Standards, Software systems, Engines"," we propose an automated approach based on machine learning that would recommend a priority level based on information available in bug reports.

Users can report bugs that they encounter in such a system. Bug reporting is inherently an uncoordinated distributed process though and thus when a user submits a new bug report, there might be cases when another bug report describing exactly the same problem is already present in the system. Such bug reports are duplicate of each other and these duplicate bug reports need to be identified. A number of past studies have proposed a number of automated approaches to detect duplicate bug reports. However, these approaches are not integrated to existing bug tracking systems. In this paper, we propose a tool named DupFinder, which implements the state-of-theart unsupervised duplicate bug report approach by Runeson et al., as a Bugzilla extension. DupFinder does not require any training data and thus can easily be deployed to any project. DupFinder extracts texts from summary and description fields of a new bug report and recent bug reports present in a bug tracking system, uses vector space model to measure similarity of bug reports, and provides developers with a list of potential duplicate bug reports based on the similarity of these reports with the new bug report.

It is often tedious and costly to manually assign these bug reports to developers who have the expertise to fix the bugs. Many bug triage techniques have been proposed to automate this process. In this paper, we describe our study on applying conventional bug triage techniques to projects of different sizes. We find that the effectiveness of a bug triage technique largely depends on the size of a project team (measured in terms of the number of developers). The conventional bug triage methods become less effective when the number of developers increases. To further improve the effectiveness of bug triage for large projects, we propose a novel recommendation method called Bug Fixer, which recommends developers for a new bug report based on historical bug-fix information. Bug Fixer constructs a Developer-Component-Bug (DCB) network, which models the relationship between developers and source code components, as well as the relationship between the components and their associated bugs. A DCB network captures the knowledge of ""who fixed what, where"". For a new bug report, Bug Fixer uses a DCB network to recommend to triager a list of suitable developers who could fix this bug.

Developers would then fix some of the bugs and commit corresponding code changes into version control systems such as svn or git. Unfortunately, the links between bug reports and code changes are missing for many software projects as the bug tracking and version control systems are often maintained separately. Yet, linking bug reports to fix commits is important as it could shed light into the nature of bug fixing processes and expose patterns in software management. Bug linking solutions, such as ReLink, have been proposed. The demonstration of their effectiveness however faces a number of issues, including a reliability issue with their ground truth datasets as well as the extent of their measurements. We propose in this study a benchmark for evaluating bug linking solutions. This benchmark includes a dataset of about 12,000 bug links from 10 programs.

Due to this trend, the complexity of these “apps” has been increasing, making development and maintenance challenging. Current bug tracking systems do not effectively facilitate the creation of bug reports with useful information that will directly lead to a bug’s resolution. To address the need for an improved reporting system, we introduce a novel solution, called Fusion, that helps reporters auto-complete reproduction steps in bug reports for mobile apps by taking advantage of their GUI-centric nature. Fusion links information, that reporters provide, to program artifacts extracted through static and dynamic analysis performed beforehand. This allows our system to facilitate the reporting process for developers and testers, while generating more reproducible bug reports with immediately actionable information.","Bug reports, android, reproduction steps, auto-completion","we introduce a novel solution, called Fusion, that helps reporters auto-complete reproduction steps in bug reports for mobile apps by taking advantage of their GUI-centric nature.",Reportador,N/A,N/A,N/A,Fusion,Sim,Sim,Sim,

The goal is to reduce testing efforts for the development team. However, often, multiple bug reports are committed for the same bug, which, if not recognized as duplicates, can result in work done multiple times by the development team. Duplicate recognition is, in turn, tedious, requiring to examine large amounts of bug reports. Previous work addresses this problem by employing natural-language processing and text similarity measures to automate bug-report duplicate detection. The downside of these techniques is that, to be applicable, they require a reporting user to go through the time-consuming process of describing the problem, just to get informed that the bug is already known. To address this problem, we propose an approach that only uses stack traces and their structure as input to machine-learning algorithms for detecting bug-report duplicates. The key advantage is that stack traces are available without a written bug report.

When bug reporters submit bug reports to a bug-tracking system, the bug reporters need to label the bug reports as security bug reports (SBRs) or not, to indicate whether the involved bugs are security problems. These SBRs generally deserve higher priority in bug fixing than not-security bug reports (NSBRs). However, in the bug-reporting process, bug reporters often mislabel SBRs as NSBRs partly due to lack of security domain knowledge. This mislabeling could cause serious damage to software-system stakeholders due to the induced delay of identifying and fixing the involved security bugs. To address this important issue, we developed a new approach that applies text mining on natural-language descriptions of BRs to train a statistical model on already manually-labeled BRs to identify SBRs that are manually-mislabeled as NSBRs. Security engineers can use the model to automate the classification of BRs from large bug databases to reduce the time that they spend on searching for SBRs. We evaluated the model's predictions on a large Cisco software system with over ten million source lines of code. Among a sample of BRs that Cisco bug reporters manually labeled as NSBRs in bug reporting, our model successfully classified a high percentage (78%) of the SBRs as verified by Cisco security engineers, and predicted their classification as SBRs with a probability of at least 0.98.","bug-tracking system, security bug reports, text mining, industrial case study, Bugzilla, development teams, testing teams, end users, software system stakeholders, natural language descriptions, statistical model, Cisco software system, Cisco security engineers",we developed a new approach that applies text mining on natural-language descriptions of BRs to train a statistical model on already manually-labeled BRs to identify SBRs that are manually-mislabeled as NSBRs,"Gerente de Requisição de Mudança, Agendador, Desenvolvedor, Analista de Qualidade",TAGS,Stream of characters,With Learning | Neural network,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

Based on bug reports managed by the bug tracking system, triagers who assign a bug to fixers and fixers need to pinpoint buggy files that should be fixed. However if triagers do not know the details of the buggy file, it is difficult to select an appropriate fixer. If fixers can identify the buggy files, they can fix the bug in a short time. In this paper, we propose a method to quickly locate the buggy file in a source code repository using 3 approaches, text mining, code mining, and change history mining to rank files that may be causing bugs. (1) The text mining approach ranks files based on the textual similarity between a bug report and source code. (2) The code mining approach ranks files based on prediction of the fault-prone module using source code product metrics. (3) The change history mining approach ranks files based on prediction of the fault-prone module using change process metrics. Using Eclipse platform project data, our proposed model gains around 20% in TOP1 prediction. This result means that the buggy files are ranked first in 20% of bug reports. Furthermore, bug reports that consist of a short description and many specific words easily identify and locate the buggy file.","Change history mining, Bug localization, Text mining, Code mining","In this paper, we propose a method to quickly locate the buggy file in a source code repository using 3 approaches, text mining, code mining, and change history mining to rank files that may be causing bugs",Agendador,Keyword-basead,Vector space,With Logic | Algebra,Bugzilla,Sim,Não,Sim,

Those systems allow the users to submit reports that describe the failure and the possible causes that led to the error. Bug trackers have evolved and adapted their interfaces to guide the user through the submission of relevant information. However, despite the refinement of the interfaces and improvements, such as the gathering of metadata describing the runtime context, the description of a defect is still composed of plain text. This representation allows flexibility in describing a defect, but the information included in the report is hard to extract and interpret, thus representing an ineffective and unintuitive method to precisely describe a problem. Our work aims to improve the workflow of developers in dealing with bug reports. This begins with promoting a bug report -- often considered as a side effect of the development process -- to independent entity with specific properties that can be exploited to describe and understand a system. We believe that, by automating the steps that lead to the creation of a bug report, we can generate meaningful information that can be automatically elaborated to produce insightful views on the failure environment, like interactive visualizations or linking with artifacts produced during development, and aid the interpretation of a bug report. Finally, we want to integrate the reporting process with elements from game design theory, to stimulate interaction between developers and people in the community and create fruitful cooperation in software ecosystems.",N/A,"Improve how bug reports are collected and managed,

It is judged from three metrics -- the coherence of issue reports’ ID, the existence of an issue report’s basic information and activity information, and the completeness of changes on an issue report status. DQE will analyze the data submitted by users, and show users the data quality evaluation chart from three aspects. We had DQE applied to the GNOME community’s issue-tracking data that we collected for research, and we obtained the result of data quality evaluation.

Such linking information is crucial for research in mining software repositories in measuring software defects and maintenance efforts. However, the state-of-the-art bug-to-fix link recovery approaches still rely much on textual matching between bug reports and commit/change logs and cannot handle well the cases where their contents are not textually similar. This paper introduces MLink, a multi-layered approach that takes into account not only textual features but also source code features of the changed code corresponding to the commit logs. It is also capable of learning the association relations between the terms in bug reports and the names of entities/components in the changed source code of the commits from the established bug-to-fix links, and uses them for link recovery between the reports and commits that do not share much similar texts. Our empirical evaluation on real-world projects shows that MLink can improve the state-of-the-art bug-to-fix link recovery methods by 11--18%, 13--17%, and 8--17% in F-score, recall, and precision, respectively.","Bug-to-Fix Links, Bugs, Fixes, Mining Software Repository","This paper introduces MLink, a multi-layered approach that takes into account not only textual features but also source code features of the changed code corresponding to the commit logs.

Each of these issues is typically triaged by hand, a time consuming and error prone task. Additionally, issue reporters lack the necessary understanding to know whether their issue has previously been reported. This leads to issue trackers containing a lot of duplicate reports, adding complexity to the triaging task. Duplicate bug report detection is designed to aid developers by automatically grouping bug reports concerning identical issues. Previous work by Alipour et al. has shown that the textual, categorical, and contextual information of an issue report are effective measures in duplicate bug report detection. In our work, we extend previous work by introducing a range of metrics based on the topic distribution of the issue reports, relying only on data taken directly from bug reports. In particular, we introduce a novel metric that measures the first shared topic between two topic-document distributions. This paper details the evaluation of this group of pair-based metrics with a range of machine learning classifiers, using the same issues used by Alipour et al. We demonstrate that the proposed metrics show a significant improvement over previous work, and conclude that the simple metrics we propose should be considered in future studies on bug report deduplication, as well as for more general natural language processing applications.","Duplicate bug reports, topic model, machine learning","In our work, we extend previous work by introducing a range of metrics based on the topic distribution of the issue reports, relying only on data taken directly from bug reports.

The information contained in the previously reported similar bugs can be helpful in fixing and resolving the newly reported bugs.

Many projects receive many reports of bugs and it is challenging for developers to manually debug and fix them. To mitigate this problem, past studies have proposed information retrieval (IR)-based bug localization techniques, which takes as input a textual description of a bug stored in an issue tracking system, and returns a list of potentially buggy source code files.These studies often evaluate their effectiveness on issue reports marked as bugs in issue tracking systems, using as ground truth the set of files that are modified in commits that fix each bug. However, there are a number of potential biases that can impact the validity of the results reported in these studies. First, issue reports marked as bugs might not be reports of bugs due to error in the reporting and classification process. Many issue reports are about documentation update, request for improvement, refactoring, code cleanups, etc. Second, bug reports might already explicitly specify the buggy program files and for these reports bug localization techniques are not needed. Third, files that get modified in commits that fix the bugs might not contain the bug. This study investigates the extent these potential biases affect the results of a bug localization technique and whether bug localization researchers need to consider these potential biases when evaluating their solutions. In this paper, we analyse issue reports from three different projects: HTTPClient, Jackrabbit, and Lucene-Java to examine the impact of above three biases on bug localization. Our results show that one of these biases significantly and substantially impacts bug localization results, while the other two biases have negligible or minor impact.","Issue Reports, Bug Localization, Bias, Empirical Study","This study investigates the extent these potential biases affect the results of a bug localization technique and whether bug localization researchers need to consider these potential biases when evaluating their solutions.

The former methods can achieve high accuracy (82%) in the top 10 results in some dataset, but they do not really reduce the workload of developers. The latter methods still need further improvement on the performance. In this paper, we propose a practical duplicate bug reports detection method, which aims to help project team to reduce their workload by combining existing two categories of methods.

Most such systems are designed around the central metaphor of the ""issue"" (bug, defect, ticket, feature, etc.), yet increasingly this model seems ill fitted to the practical needs of growing software projects; for example, our analysis of interviews with 20 Mozilla developers who use Bugzilla heavily revealed that developers face challenges maintaining a global understanding of the issues they are involved with, and that they desire improved support for situational awareness that is difficult to achieve with current issue management systems. In this paper we motivate the need for personalized issue tracking that is centered around the information needs of individual developers together with improved logistical support for the tasks they perform. We also describe an initial approach to implement such a system — extending Bugzilla — that enhances a developer's situational awareness of their working context by providing views that are tailored to specific tasks they frequently perform; we are actively improving this prototype with input from Mozilla developers",N/A, we motivate the need for personalized issue tracking that is centered around the information needs of individual developers together with improved logistical support for the tasks they perform.

RE-OPENED BUGS,"A typical bug fixing cycle involves the reporting of a bug, the triaging of the report, the production and verification of a fix, and the closing of the bug. However, previous work has studied two phenomena where more than one fix are associated with the same bug report. The first one is the case where developers re-open a previously fixed bug in the bug repository (sometimes even multiple times) to provide a new bug fix that replace a previous fix, whereas the second one is the case where multiple commits in the version control system contribute to the same bug report (“supplementary bug fixes”). Even though both phenomena seem related, they have never been studied together,i.e., are supplementary fixes a subset of re-opened bugs or the other way around? This paper investigates the interplay between both phenomena in five open source software projects: Mozilla, Netbeans, Eclipse JDT Core, Eclipse Platform SWT, and WebKit. We found that re-opened bugs account for between 21.6% and 33.8% of all supplementary fixes. However, 33% to 57.5% of reopened bugs had only one commit associated, which means that the original bug report was prematurely closed instead of fixed incorrectly. Furthermore, we constructed predictive models for re-opened bugs using historical information about supplementary bug fixes with a precision between 72.2% and 97%, as well as a recall between 47.7% and 65.3%.

Such cases of undetected cross-distribution bug duplicates can cause developers and users to lose precious time working on a fix that already exists or to work individually instead of collaborating to find a fix faster. We perform a case study on Ubuntu and Debian bug repositories to measure the amount of cross-distribution bug duplicates and estimate the amount of time lost. By adapting an existing within-project duplicate detection approach (achieving a similar recall of 60%), we find 821 cross-duplicates. The early detection of such duplicates could reduce the time lost by users waiting for a fix by a median of 38 days. Furthermore, we estimate that developers from the different distributions lose a median of 47 days in which they could have collaborated together, had they been aware of duplicates. These results show the need to detect and monitor cross-distribution duplicates.","Computer bugs, Linux, Collaboration, Organizations, Feature extraction, Generators, Information retrieval ","We perform a case study on Ubuntu and Debian bug repositories to measure the amount of cross-distribution bug duplicates and estimate the amount of time lost.

In particular, defect data often appears not in sync when considering what developers logged as their actions. Synchronizing or completing the missing data of the bug repositories, with the logs detailing the actions of developers, would benefit various branches of empirical software engineering research: prediction of software faults, software reliability, traceability, software quality, effort and cost estimation, bug prediction and bug fixing.Objective: To design a framework that automates the process of synchronizing and filling the gaps of the development logs and bug issue data for open source software projects.Method: We instantiate the framework with a sample of OSS projects from GitHub, and by parsing, linking and filling the gaps found in their bug issue data, and development logs. UML diagrams show the relevant modules that will be used to merge, link and connect the bug issue data with the development data.Results: Analysing a sample of over 300 OSS projects we observed that around 1/2 of bug-related data is present in either development logs or issue tracker logs: the rest of the data is missing from one or the other source. We designed an automated approach that fills the gaps of either source by making use of the available data, and we successfully mapped all the missing data of the analysed projects, when using one heuristics of annotating bugs. Other heuristics need to be investigated and implemented.Conclusion: In this paper a framework to synchronise the development logs and bug data used in empirical software engineering was designed to automatically fill the missing parts of development logs and bugs of issue data.","Bug traceability, Bug accuracy, bug-fixing commits,",In this paper a framework to synchronise the development logs and bug data used in empirical software engineering was designed to automatically fill the missing parts of development logs and bugs of issue data.,"Desenvolvedor, Analista de Qualidade",N/A,N/A,N/A,Github Issue Tracking System,Sim,Não,Sim,

In order to identify such duplicates accurately, in this paper we propose a retrieval function (REP) to measure the similarity between two bug reports. It fully utilizes the information available in a bug report including not only the similarity of textual content in summary and description fields, but also similarity of non-textual fields such as product, component, version, etc. For more accurate measurement of textual similarity, we extend BM25F - an effective similarity formula in information retrieval community, specially for duplicate report retrieval. Lastly we use a two-round stochastic gradient descent to automatically optimize REP for specific bug repositories in a supervised learning manner. We have validated our technique on three large software bug repositories from Mozilla, Eclipse and OpenOffice. The experiments show 10-27% relative improvement in recall rate@k and 17-23% relative improvement in mean average precision over our previous model. We also applied our technique to a very large dataset consisting of 209,058 reports from Eclipse, resulting in a recall rate@k of 37-71% and mean average precision of 47%","bug duplicate, BM25F, textual similarity,","we propose a retrieval function (REP) to measure the similarity between two bug reports.

A large number of bugs often indicate poor software quality, since buggy behavior not only causes failures that may be costly but also has a detrimental effect on the user’s overall experience with the software product. The impact of long lived bugs can be even more critical since experiencing the same bug version after version can be particularly frustrating for user. While there are many studies that investigate factors affecting bug fixing time for entire bug repositories, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies investigates the extent and reasons of long lived bugs.Objective:In this paper, we investigate the triaging and fixing processes of long lived bugs so that we can identify the reasons for delay and improve the overall bug fixing process.Methodology:We mine the bug repositories of popular open source projects, and analyze long lived bugs from five different perspectives: their proportion, severity, assignment, reasons, as well as the nature of fixes.Results:Our study on seven open-source projects shows that there are a considerable number of long lived bugs in each system and over 90% of them adversely affect the user’s experience. The reasons for these long lived bugs are diverse including long assignment time, not understanding their importance in advance, etc. However, many bug-fixes were delayed without any specific reasons. Furthermore, 40% of long lived bugs need only small fixes.Conclusion:Our overall results suggest that a significant number of long lived bugs may be minimized through careful triaging and prioritization if developers could predict their severity, change effort, and change impact in advance. We believe our results will help both developers and researchers better to understand factors behind delays, improve the overall bug fixing process, and investigate analytical approaches for prioritizing bugs based on bug severity as well as expected bug fixing effort.","Bug tracking, Bug triaging, Bug survival time","Our study on seven open-source projects shows that there are a considerable number of long lived bugs in each system and over 90% of them adversely affect the user’s experience.

However, these reports widely differ in their quality. We conducted a survey among developers and users of APACHE, ECLIPSE, and MOZILLA to find out what makes a good bug report. The analysis of the 466 responses revealed an information mismatch between what developers need and what users supply. Most developers consider steps to reproduce, stack traces, and test cases as helpful, which are, at the same time, most difficult to provide for users. Such insight is helpful for designing new bug tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more helpful information. Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and measures the quality of new bug reports; it also recommends which elements should be added to improve the quality. We trained CUEZILLA on a sample of 289 bug reports, rated by developers as part of the survey. The participants of our survey also provided 175 comments on hurdles in reporting and resolving bugs. Based on these comments, we discuss several recommendations for better bug tracking systems, which should focus on engaging bug reporters, better tool support, and improved handling of bug duplicate","bug report, data quality","Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and measures the quality

04/12/2016 17:21:57,Thung2012,WHEN WOULD THIS BUG GET REPORTED?,"Not all bugs in software would be experienced and reported by end users right away: Some bugs manifest themselves quickly and may be reported by users a few days after they get into the code base; others manifest many months or even years later, and may only be experienced and reported by a small number of users. We refer to the period of time between the time when a bug is introduced into code and the time when it is reported by a user as bug reporting latency. Knowledge of bug reporting latencies has an implication on prioritization of bug fixing activities-bugs with low reporting latencies may be fixed earlier than those with high latencies to shift debugging resources towards bugs highly concerning users. To investigate bug reporting latencies, we analyze bugs from three Java software systems: AspectJ, Rhino, and Lucene. We extract bug reporting data from their version control repositories and bug tracking systems, identify bug locations based on bug fixes, and back-trace bug introducing time based on change histories of the buggy code. Also, we remove non-essential changes, and most importantly, recover root causes of bugs from their treatments/fixes. We then calculate the bug reporting latencies, and find that bugs have diverse reporting latencies. Based on the calculated reporting latencies and features we extract from bugs, we build classification models that can predict whether a bug would be reported early (within 30 days) or later, which may be helpful for prioritizing bug fixing activities. Our evaluation on the three software systems shows that our bug reporting latency prediction models could achieve an AUC (Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics Curve) of 70.869%.","Computer bugs, Feature extraction, Software systems, Predictive models, Java, Databases, Conferences","In this paper, we are interested in understanding the time between the introduction of a bug into the code base of a software system and the reporting of the bug by users after they start to use the program.
