Bugzilla,Reports and Charts,"Bugzilla has a very advanced reporting systems. If you want to know how your bug database looks right now, you can create a table using any two fields as the X and Y axis, and using any search criteria to limit the bugs you want information on. For example, you could pick Product as the X axis, and Status as the Y axis, and then you would see a report of how many bugs were in each Status, in each Product. You can also view that same table as a line graph, bar graph, or pie chart. You can also specify a ""Z axis"" to generate multiple tables or graphs.
You can even export these reports as CSV so that you can work with them in a spreadsheet. Finally, to see how your Bugzilla installation has changed over time, Bugzilla also supports a charting system, which can create graphs that track changes in the system over time.",Conforme a documentação a funcionalidade tem foco no usuário final.,https://www.bugzilla.org/features/#reporting,Geração de Relatórios,Visualização e Monitoramento de RM's

Bugzilla is also very careful about information leaks--if you use Bugzilla's group system to hide something, it is absolutely hidden. Nobody will be able to get any information about it whatsoever. Also, email addresses of users are not available to logged out users, to make life harder to spammers.

Screenshot of creating a reference Issue in another repository? Just include the repository before the name like kneath/example-project#42. One of the more interesting ways to use GitHub Issues is to reference issues directly from commits. Include the issue number inside of the commit message. Screenshot of referencing a commit By prefacing your commits with “Fixes”, “Fixed”, “Fix”, “Closes”, “Closed”, or “Close” when the commit is merged into master, it will also automatically close the issue. References make it possible to deeply connect the work being done with the bug being tracked, and are a great way to add visibility into the history of your project.",,https://guides.github.com/features/issues/,Suporte ao Relato da RM,Operações de CRUD
