For more complex tasks, Bugzilla has a very advanced Extensions system that allows you drop files into any Bugzilla installation and change its behavior in various ways.

This functionality is in beta and is available for free to all Enterprise Edition customers. As we expand on this feature, we will remove it from Beta and a new License key will need to be issued to use it.",
11/12/2016 22:56:43,Gitlab Issue Tracking System,https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/automatic_issue_closing.html,Automatic issue closing ,"When a commit or merge request resolves one or more issues, it is possible to automatically have these issues closed when the commit or merge request lands in the project's default branch. If a commit message or merge request description contains a sentence matching a certain regular expression, all issues referenced from the matched text will be closed. This happens when the commit is pushed to a project's default branch, or when a commit or merge request is merged into it.",
11/12/2016 22:58:18,Gitlab Issue Tracking System,https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html,Description templates ,"By using the description templates, users that create a new issue or merge request can select a description template to help them communicate with other contributors effectively.

Every GitLab project can define its own set of description templates as they are added to the root directory of a GitLab project's repository.

Description templates must be written in Markdown and stored in your project's repository under a directory named .gitlab. Only the templates of the default branch will be taken into account.",
11/12/2016 23:00:16,Gitlab Issue Tracking System,https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/issue_weight.html,Issue Weight ,"When you have a lot of issues, it can be hard to get an overview. By adding a weight to each issue, you can get a better idea of how much time, value or complexity a given issue has or will cost.

You can set the weight of an issue during its creation, by simply changing the value in the dropdown menu. You can set it to a numeric value from 1 to 9.

This value will appear on the right sidebar of an individual issue, as well as in the issues page next to a distinctive balance scale icon.

As an added bonus, you can see the total sum of all issues on the milestone page.",

A common use is keeping track of an upcoming software version. Milestones are created per-project.",
