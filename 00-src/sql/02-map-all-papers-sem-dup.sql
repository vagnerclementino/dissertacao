For a small dim object, conventional tracking methods fail for the lack of geometrical information. Multiple hypotheses testing (MHT) is one of the generally accepted methods in target tracking systems. However, processing a tree structure with a significant number of branches in MHT has been a challenging issue. Tracking high-speed objects with traditional MHT requires some presumptions which limit the capabilities of these methods. This study presents a hierarchal tracking system in two levels to solve this problem. For each point in the lower-level, a multi objective particle swarm optimisation technique is applied to a group of consecutive frames to reduce the number of branches in each tracking tree. Thus, an optimum track for each moving object is obtained in a group of frames. In the upper-level, an iterative process is used to connect the matching optimum tracks of the consecutive frames based on the spatial information and fitness values. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a superior performance in relation to some common dim object tracking methods over different image sequence data sets.', NULL, NULL, 'K.

However, previous work has studied two phenomena where more than one fix are associated with the same bug report. The first one is the case where developers re-open a previously fixed bug in the bug repository (sometimes even multiple times) to provide a new bug fix that replace a previous fix, whereas the second one is the case where multiple commits in the version control system contribute to the same bug report (\"supplementary bug fixes\"). Even though both phenomena seem related, they have never been studied together, i.e., are supplementary fixes a subset of re-opened bugs or the other way around? This paper investigates the interplay between both phenomena in five open source software projects: Mozilla, Net beans, Eclipse JDT Core, Eclipse Platform SWT, and Web Kit. We found that re-opened bugs account for between 21.6% and 33.8% of all supplementary fixes. However, 33% to 57.5% of re-opened bugs had only one commit associated, which means that the original bug report was prematurely closed instead of fixed incorrectly. Furthermore, we constructed predictive models for re-opened bugs using historical information about supplementary bug fixes with a precision between 72.2% and 97%, as well as a recall between 47.7% and 65.3%. Software researchers and practitioners who are mining data repositories can use our approach to identify potential failures of their bug fixes and the re-opening of bug reports.', NULL, NULL, 'L.

For example, queries such as locating and browsing the faultiest methods are not provided. This paper addresses such issues and proposes an approach and a framework to consistently merge information extracted from source code, versioning repositories and bug reports. Our information representation exploits the property concepts of the FAMIX information exchange meta-model, allowing to represent, browse, and query, at different level of abstractions, the concept of interest. This allows the user to navigate back and forth from versioning system modification reports to bug reports and to source code.

Furthermore, the Office of the Secretary of Defense(OSD) Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) has provided goals which drive the usage of CREATE software by DoD Acquisition Programs. In order to achieve these usage targets, the CREATE Program has established a governance model and thence a hosted set of services to enhance collaboration among the developer teams and the targeted Acquisition Program (AP) subject matter experts. The goals of these collaboration services are to: 1) scale and speed the feedback amongst the CREATE and AP teams, while 2) minimizing interruption to developer and user workflows. Towards these goals, the community services have been architected as discussion forums, issue tracking, and documentation. Such services are now common place in the enterprise and open-source software projects, and efficiently scale with the user community by enabling a searchable knowledge base.

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the “big-dataism”. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources.

Most developers consider steps to reproduce, stack traces, and test cases as helpful, which are at the same time most difficult to provide for users. Such insight is helpful to design new bug tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more helpful information. Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and measures the quality of new bug reports; it also recommends which elements should be added to improve the quality.

Yet, linking bug reports to fix commits is important as it could shed light into the nature of bug fixing processes and expose patterns in software management. Bug linking solutions, such as ReLink, have been proposed. The demonstration of their effectiveness however faces a number of issues, including a reliability issue with their ground truth datasets as well as the extent of their measurements. We propose in this study a benchmark for evaluating bug linking solutions. This benchmark includes a dataset of about 12,000 bug links from 10 programs. These true links between bug reports and their fixes have been provided during bug fixing processes. We designed a number of research questions, to assess both quantitatively and qualitatively the effectiveness of a bug linking tool.

We perform a case study on Ubuntu and Debian bug repositories to measure the amount of cross-distribution bug duplicates and estimate the amount of time lost. By adapting an existing within-project duplicate detection approach (achieving a similar recall of 60%), we find 821 cross-duplicates. The early detection of such duplicates could reduce the time lost by users waiting for a fix by a median of 38 days. Furthermore, we estimate that developers from the different distributions lose a median of 47 days in which they could have collaborated together, had they been aware of duplicates.

However, the benefits of CR repositories do not come without issues, and commonly occurring ones should be dealt with, such as the following: duplicate CRs, the large number of CRs to assign, or poorly described CRs. Such issues have led researchers to an increased interest in investigating CR repositories, by considering different aspects of software development and CR management.

In this paper we propose an automated approach for determining vulnerabilities pertinent to the current network/ system configuration using the information aggregated from different bug tracking communities. Such vulnerability assessment and indication mechanisms significantly alleviate the system administratorÂ¿s burden of manual content digging for vulnerabilities in his own configuration context. Furthermore, we propose an Extensible Defense Oriented Representation Schema (EDORS) for vulnerability representation, which is subsequently used by the policy engine to generate appropriate signatures.

In order to quickly identify the fixer to bug reports we present an approach based on the bug tossing history and textual similarities between bug reports.

The extension contains features such as annotating (using tags, title and description) and saving web references pertaining to multiple bug reports and tasks and then posting it as bibliography (for easy citation and reference) in issue tracking system comments. &copy; 2013 IEEE.', 'Bangkok, Thailand', NULL, 'Correa, Denzil and Lal, Sangeeta and Saini, Apoorv and Sureka, Ashish', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Proceedings - Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference, APSEC', 'Social networking (online)', 'Chromium;Computer software maintenance;Human resource management;Productivity;Program debugging;Quality assurance;Software engineering;Surveys;Tracking (position);Websites;World Wide Web;', 'English', NULL, NULL, 'Bug reports;Characterization studies;Data characterization;Empirical Software Engineering;Mining software repository (MSR);Productivity tools;Threaded discussions;Version control system;', NULL, NULL, '25 - 33', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Samekana: A Browser Extension for including relevant web links in issue tracking system discussion forum', NULL, 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/APSEC.2013.15', '1', '2013', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2016.06.08', 'vagner', NULL, '[vagner:6]', 'Correa2013c', '1');

Stack overflow is a popular community-based question and answering website for programmers and is widely used by software engineers as it contains answers to millions of questions (an extensive knowledge resource) posted by programmers on diverse topics. We conduct a series of experiments on open-source Google Chromium and Android issue tracker data (publicly available real-world dataset) to understand the role and impact of Stack overflow in issue resolution. Our experimental results show evidences of several references to Stack overflow in threaded discussions and demonstrate correlation between a lower mean time to repair (in one dataset) with presence of Stack overflow links.

We conduct experiments based on textual similarly analysis (content-based linguistic features) and contextual data analysis (exploited metadata such as tags associated to a Stack overflow question) to recommend Stack overflow questions for an incoming bug report.

This is particularly true for projects that rely on Git, the most popular SCM system today. In this paper, we propose a conceptual schema for Git and an approach that, given a Git repository, exports its data to a relational database in order to (1) promote data integration with other existing SCM tools and (2) enable writing queries on Git data using standard SQL syntax. To ensure efficiency, our approach comes with an incremental propagation mechanism that refreshes the database content with the latest modifications.

Unfortunately, this information is not usually recorded when fixing bugs, and recovering it later is challenging. Recently, the text approach and the dependence approach have been developed to tackle this problem. Respectively, they examine textual and dependence-related changes that occurred prior to a bug fix. However, only limited evaluation has been carried out, partially because of a lack of available implementations and of datasets linking bugs to origins. To address this, origins of 174 bugs in three projects were manually identified and compared to a simulation of the approaches. Both approaches were partially successful across a variety of bugs - achieving 29-79% precision and 40-70% recall. Results suggested the precise definition of program dependence could affect performance, as could whether the approaches identified a single or multiple origins. Some potential improvements are explored in detail and identify pragmatic strategies for combining techniques along with simple modifications. Even after adopting these improvements, there remain many challenges: large commits, unrelated changes and long periods between origins and fixes all reduce effectiveness.

Therefore, reducing the MTTR (Mean Time to Restore) of a service remains the most important step to assure the user-perceived availability of the service. To reduce the MTTR, a common practice is to restore the service by identifying and applying an appropriate healing action (i.e., a temporary workaround action such as rebooting a SQL machine). However, manually identifying an appropriate healing action for a given new issue (such as service down) is typically time consuming and error prone. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present an automated mining-based approach for suggesting an appropriate healing action for a given new issue. Our approach generates signatures of an issue from its corresponding transaction logs and then retrieves historical issues from a historical issue repository. Finally, our approach suggests an appropriate healing action by adapting healing actions for the retrieved historical issues. We have implemented a healing suggestion system for our approach and applied it to a real-world product online service that serves millions of online customers globally.

In practice, most defect taxonomies are used only for the a posteriori allocation of testing resources to prioritize failures for debugging. Thus, these taxonomies'' full potential to control and improve all the steps of testing has remained unexploited. This is especially the case for testing a system''s user requirements. System-level defect taxonomies can improve the design of requirements-based tests, the tracing of defects to requirements, the quality assessment of requirements, and the control of the relevant defect management.

The GENTOO project is known for a period of centralization within its bug triaging community. This was followed by considerable changes in community organization and performance after the sudden retirement of the central contributor. We analyze how this event correlates with the negative emotions, both in bilateral email discussions with the central contributor, and at the level of the whole community of contributors. We then extend our study to consider the activity patterns of GENTOO contributors in general. We find that contributors are more likely to become inactive when they express strong positive or negative emotions in the bug tracker, or when they deviate from the expected value of emotions in the mailing list.

When bug reporters submit bug reports to a bug-tracking system, the bug reporters need to label the bug reports as security bug reports (SBRs) or not, to indicate whether the involved bugs are security problems. These SBRs generally deserve higher priority in bug fixing than not-security bug reports (NSBRs). However, in the bug-reporting process, bug reporters often mislabel SBRs as NSBRs partly due to lack of security domain knowledge. This mislabeling could cause serious damage to software-system stakeholders due to the induced delay of identifying and fixing the involved security bugs. To address this important issue, we developed a new approach that applies text mining on natural-language descriptions of BRs to train a statistical model on already manually-labeled BRs to identify SBRs that are manually-mislabeled as NSBRs. Security engineers can use the model to automate the classification of BRs from large bug databases to reduce the time that they spend on searching for SBRs. We evaluated the model''s predictions on a large Cisco software system with over ten million source lines of code. Among a sample of BRs that Cisco bug reporters manually labeled as NSBRs in bug reporting, our model successfully classified a high percentage (78%) of the SBRs as verified by Cisco security engineers, and predicted their classification as SBRs with a probability of at least 0.98.', NULL, NULL, 'M.

To tackle this problem we have developed SOFA S, a distributed and collaborative software analysis platform to enable a seamless interoperation of such analyses.

SOFA S services are accessible through a software analysis catalog where any project stakeholder can, depending on the needs or interests, pick specific analyses, combine them, let them run remotely and then fetch the final results. That way, software developers, testers, architects, or quality assurance experts are given access to quality analysis services. They are shielded from many peculiarities of tool installations and configurations, but SOFA S offers them sophisticated and easy-to-use analyses.

Process cube is a concept which falls at the intersection of OLAP cube and process mining. Process cube facilitates process mining from multiple-dimensions and enables comparison of process mining results across various dimensions. We present an application of process cube to software defect resolution process to analyze and compare process data from a multi-dimensional perspective. We present a framework, a novel perspective to mine software repositories using process cube. Each cell of process cube is defined by metrics from multiple process mining perspectives like control flow, time, conformance and organizational perspective. We conduct a case-study on Google Chromium project data in which the software defect resolution process spans three software repositories: Issue Tracking System (ITS), Peer Code Review System (PCR) and Version Control System (VCS). We define process cube with 9 dimensions as issue report timestamp, priority, state, closed status, OS, component, bug type, reporter and owner. We define hierarchies along various dimensions and cluster members to handle sparsity.

Process mining consists of analyzing event log data produced from Process Aware Information Systems (PAIS) for the purpose of discovering and improving business processes. Process cube is a concept which falls at the intersection of OLAP cube and process mining. Process cube facilitates process mining from multiple-dimensions and enables comparison of process mining results across various dimensions. We present an application of process cube to software defect resolution process to analyze and compare process data from a multi-dimensional perspective. We present a framework, a novel perspective to mine software repositories using process cube. Each cell of process cube is defined by metrics from multiple process mining perspectives like control flow, time, conformance and organizational perspective. We conduct a case-study on Google Chromium project data in which the software defect resolution process spans three software repositories: Issue Tracking System (ITS), Peer Code Review System (PCR) and Version Control System (VCS). We define process cube with 9 dimensions as issue report timestamp, priority, state, closed status, OS, component, bug type, reporter and owner. We define hierarchies along various dimensions and cluster members to handle sparsity.

This paper aims to characterize the known coding errors. Nowadays, the popularity of the source code hosting services like GitHub are increasing rapidly. They provide a variety of services, among which the most important ones are the version and bug tracking systems. Version control systems store all versions of the source code, and bug tracking systems provide a unified interface for reporting errors. Bug reports can be used to identify the wrong and the previously fixed source code parts, thus the bugs can be characterized by static source code metrics or by other quantitatively measured properties using the gathered data. We chose GitHub for the base of data collection and we selected 13 Java projects for analysis. As a result, a database was constructed, which characterizes the bugs of the examined projects, thus can be used, inter alia, to improve the automatic detection of software defects. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.', NULL, NULL, 'Gyimesi, P. and Gyimesi, G. and Tóth, Z. and Ferenc, R.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.1007/978-3-319-21413-9_4', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'cited By 0', NULL, NULL, '47-62', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Characterization of source code defects by data mining conducted on GitHub', NULL, 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949035043&partnerID=40&md5=ba165cfec7835e69230732297c5f7f39', '9159', '2015', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2016.06.08', 'vagner', NULL, '[vagner:]', 'Gyimesi2015', '1');

However, the counting process eliminates information about the temporal alignment of events leading to changes in the attributes count. Software quality teams could plan and prioritize their work more efficiently if they were aware of these temporal sequences and knew their frequency of occurrence. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset mined from the Fire fox bug repository (Bugzilla) which contains information about the temporal alignment of developer interactions. Our dataset covers eight years of data from the Fire fox project on activities throughout the project''s lifecycle. Some of these activities have not been reported in frequency-based or other temporal datasets. The dataset we mined from the Fire fox project contains new activities, such as reporter experience, file exchange events, code-review process activities, and setting of milestones.

Instead of building a single global model, which is not realistic, we propose to organize the different partial models as a network of related models, which provides a global view of the system through a correspondence model. As models are modelled separately by different designers, they also evolve separately that induces a problem of consistency. To solve it, we propose a semi-automatic process based on the correspondence model allowing detecting changes, calculating their impacts, and proposing modifications to maintain the consistency among them.

As a result, many reports end up referring to the same issue, which effectively makes the bug-report triaging process time consuming and error prone. Many researchers have approached the bug-deduplication problem using off-the-shelf information-retrieval (IR) tools. In this work, we extend the state of the art by investigating how contextual information about software-quality attributes, software-architecture terms, and system-development topics can be exploited to improve bug deduplication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our contextual bug-deduplication method at ranking duplicates on the bug repositories of the Android, Eclipse, Mozilla, and OpenOffice software systems.

Nevertheless, as the project grows a manual browsing of the project issues is no longer feasible. In this paper we present GiLA, a tool which generates a set of visualizations to facilitate the analysis of issues in a project depending on their label-based categorization.

We propose a system that automatically classifies duplicate bug reports as they arrive to save developer time.

One of the tasks of a triager is to identify whether an incoming bug report is a duplicate of a pre-existing report. In order to detect duplicate bug reports, a triager either relies on his memory and experience or on the search capabilities of the bug repository. Both these approaches can be time consuming for the triager and may also lead to the misidentification of duplicates. In the literature, several approaches to automate duplicate bug report detection have been proposed. However, there has not been an exhaustive comparison of the performance of different IR models, especially with topic-based ones such as LSI and LDA. In this paper, we compare the performance of the traditional vector space model (using different weighting schemes) with that of topic based models, leveraging heuristics that incorporate exception stack frames, surface features, summary and long description from the free-form text in the bug report. We perform experiments on subsets of bug reports from Eclipse and Firefox and achieve a recall rate of 60% and 58% respectively. We find that word-based models, in particular a Log-Entropy based weighting scheme, outperform topic based ones such as LSI, LDA and Random Projections.

We found that issue tracking tools can help facilitate student learning of communication skills by forcing students to explicitly carry out effective steps recommended by communication theories and thus improve communications among students.

An assistance system applies these rules to guide the user in different situations, beginning with an empty specification up to the implementation of various RE artifact types and traces between them.

This profile, to some extent, indicates the user''s role, expertise, and involvement in this project. These activities influence and contribute to the identification and ranking of suitable assignees. In order to evaluate our work, we apply it to bug reports of three different projects.

Researchers have to resort to heuristics to tag the data (e.g., to determine if an issue is a bug report or a work item), or to link a piece of code to a particular issue or bug. Recent studies by Bird et al. and by Antoniol et al. suggest that software models based on imperfect datasets with missing links to the code and incorrect tagging of issues, exhibit biases that compromise the validity and generality of the quality models built on top of the datasets. In this study, we verify the effects of such biases for a commercial project that enforces strict development guidelines and rules on the quality of the data in its issue tracking repository. Our results show that even in such a perfect setting, with a near-ideal dataset, biases do exist - leading us to conjecture that biases are more likely a symptom of the underlying software development process instead of being due to the used heuristics.', NULL, NULL, 'T.

Unfortunately, web applications are prone to JavaScript faults. While prior studies have demonstrated the prevalence of these faults, no attempts have been made to determine their root causes and consequences. Objective: The goal of our study is to understand the root causes and impact of JavaScript faults and how the results can impact JavaScript programmers, testers and tool developers. Method: We perform an empirical study of 317 bug reports from 12 bug repositories. The bug reports are thoroughly examined to classify and extract information about the fault''s cause (the error) and consequence (the failure and impact). Result: The majority (65%) of JavaScript faults are DOM-related, meaning they are caused by faulty interactions of the JavaScript code with the Document Object Model (DOM). Further, 80% of the highest impact JavaScript faults are DOM-related. Finally, most JavaScript faults originate from programmer mistakes committed in the JavaScript code itself, as opposed to other web application components such as the server-side or HTML code. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of DOM-related faults, JavaScript programmers need development tools that can help them reason about the DOM. Also, testers should prioritize detection of DOM-related faults as most high impact faults belong to this category. Finally, developers can use the error patterns we found to design more powerful static analysis tools for JavaScript. © 2013 IEEE.', NULL, NULL, 'Ocariza Jr., F. and Bajaj, K. and Pattabiraman, K. and Mesbah, A.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.1109/ESEM.2013.18', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'cited By 16', NULL, NULL, '55-64', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'An empirical study of client-side JavaScript bugs', NULL, 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893300715&partnerID=40&md5=0d4a67c3b8bd3fc60a3ad5ac9479f310', NULL, '2013', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2016.06.08', 'vagner', NULL, '[vagner:]', 'OcarizaJr.2013', '1');

The approach has been evaluated on to test class clusters from six Java open source systems, where NPE bugs have been artificially introduced.

In particular, a number of recently proposed mining-based software engineering techniques predict bug severity, bug report quality, and bug-fix time, according to this information. Many bug tracking systems provide a field ''severity'' offering options such as ''severe'', ''normal'', and ''minor'', with ''normal'' as the default. However, there is a widespread perception that for many bug reports the label ''normal'' may not reflect the actual severity, because reporters may overlook setting the severity or may not feel confident enough to do so. In many cases, researchers ignore ''normal'' bug reports, and thus overlook a large percentage of the reports provided. On the other hand, treating them all together risks mixing reports that have very diverse properties. In this study, we investigate the extent to which ''normal'' bug reports actually have the ''normal'' severity. We find that many ''normal'' bug reports in practice are not normal. Furthermore, this misclassification can have a significant impact on the accuracy of mining-based tools and studies that rely on bug report severity information. © 2015 IEEE.', NULL, NULL, 'Saha, R.K.a and Lawall, J.b and Khurshid, S.a and Perry, D.E.a ', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '10.1109/MSR.2015.31', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'IEEE International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'cited By 0', NULL, NULL, '258-268', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Are these bugs really ''normal''?', NULL, 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957107517&partnerID=40&md5=1d0fefdfc0cd2a2fdc3d0a816212bbf6', '2015-August', '2015', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2016.06.08', 'vagner', NULL, '[vagner:]', 'Saha2015', '1');

The developers of task and bug tracking systems now offer their solutions by a monthly fee. For instance, JIRA Studio produced by Atlassian can be connected to a corporative domain by subscription. This scheme allows software companies to reduce costs at the project''s start and get scalable resources in future. Software documentation systems can also be purchased by a subscription now. The effectiveness of their usage for various documentation development is interesting. There are four major types of documentation supporting the development process and resulted products: project, technical, code and user documentation. Each of this type claims specific requirements for the documentation tool. The requirement analysis shows that rented documentation systems are the most appropriate for user and technical documentation. There are two major classes of software documentation systems: 1) Wiki, 2) DITA-orientedXML CMS. The following wiki systems have a hosted version: commercial Confluence, Central Desktop, EditMe, Incentive, Netcipia, PBWiki, Wikia, Wikispaces; open source BusinessWiki, Metadot Wiki, MindTouch, Wagn, Wikidot. The richest by the functionality andplugin collection is Confluence produced by Atlassian. The following XML CMS are offered by a SaaS model (all are commercial): Astoria On Demand, DITA Exchange. DocZone. SaaS is optionally supported in Bluestream XDocs, Siberlogic SiberSafe, Trisoft Infoshare, Vasont, X-Hive Docato. As wiki system is a ready integrated environment for creating and publishing documentation, DITA-system consists not only of XML CMS. To deploy a DITA-system, you should have an XML editor, publisher and CMS. The listed CMS can be integrated with top DITA XML editors and provide an API to integrate with other editors. These CMS also have build-in tools to export documents in mu- - ltiple formats. However, the universal component architecture of DITA-systems makes the deployment and configuration more difficult than wiki implementation. Hosted documentation systems are offered by different prices. The offerings of top documentation systems are considered in this paper. Wiki subscription fees range from 4,95$ (EditMe) to 20$ (Confluence) per one user/month. XML CMS subscription price starts from 500$ per month and can reach 12000$ per month. These subscriptions have no fixed price; in each individual case the CMS vendor performs a specific project of a DITA-system implementation. Wiki rental costs approximate to CMS subscriptions'' costs for large number of users, 500 and more. The advantages of renting a powerful documentation system for small and large project are the following: 1) Maximal functionality at a low affordable cost, 2) Platform independency and high system accessibility, 3) Document quality improvement at the expense of quality controlling tools application, 4) Higher effectiveness of documentation (content re-use, single source usage, automated tools for localization), 5) Organization of robust and scalable documentation process. As the SaaS business model becomes more popular, small companies get access to powerful software documentation systems, which are too expensive to purchase a standalone license at the startup. However, the system''s access security, reliability and information confidentiality issues remain opened and controversial.', NULL, NULL, 'E.

It fully utilizes the information available in a bug report including not only the similarity of textual content in summary and description fields, but also similarity of non-textual fields such as product, component, version, etc. For more accurate measurement of textual similarity, we extend BM25F - an effective similarity formula in information retrieval community, specially for duplicate report retrieval.

In other words, the task of monitoring stream data inevitably involves breaks of the task, which would lose the context of monitoring. However, to the best of our knowledge, interaction design when involving breaks has not been fully studied yet. The proposed system visualizes the dynamic relationship between bugs with animation, and helps a user grasping the context of monitoring by highlighting updated bugs and the replay of animation for part of the last monitoring time. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated through experiments with test participants.

Since OWL describes the semantics of the data, EvoOnt (1) is easily extendible, (2) can be processed with many existing tools, and (3) allows to derive assertions through its inherent Description Logic reasoning capabilities. The contribution of this paper is that it introduces a novel software evolution ontology that vastly simplifies typical software evolution analysis tasks. In detail, we show the usefulness of EvoOnt by repeating selected software evolution and analysis experiments from the 2004-2007 Mining Software Repositories Workshops (MSR). We demonstrate that if the data used for analysis were available in EvoOnt then the analyses in 75% of the papers at MSR could be reduced to one or at most two simple queries within off-the-shelf SPARQL tools.

Many treatments contain non-essential changes, which are intermingled with root causes. Reverse engineering the root cause of a bug can help to understand why the bug is introduced and help to detect and prevent other bugs of similar causes. The recovered root causes are also better ground truth for bug detection and localization studies. In this work, we propose a combination of machine learning and code analysis techniques to identify root causes from the changes made to fix bugs. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach based on a golden set (i.e., ground truth data) of manually recovered root causes of 200 bug reports from three open source projects. Our approach is able to achieve a precision, recall, and F-measure (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 76.42%, 71.88%, and 74.08% respectively. Compared with the work by Kawrykow and Robillard, our approach achieves a 60.83% improvement in F-measure.', NULL, NULL, 'F. Thung and D. Lo and L.

We refer to the period of time between the time when a bug is introduced into code and the time when it is reported by a user as bug reporting latency. Knowledge of bug reporting latencies has an implication on prioritization of bug fixing activities-bugs with low reporting latencies may be fixed earlier than those with high latencies to shift debugging resources towards bugs highly concerning users. To investigate bug reporting latencies, we analyze bugs from three Java software systems: AspectJ, Rhino, and Lucene. We extract bug reporting data from their version control repositories and bug tracking systems, identify bug locations based on bug fixes, and back-trace bug introducing time based on change histories of the buggy code. Also, we remove non-essential changes, and most importantly, recover root causes of bugs from their treatments/fixes. We then calculate the bug reporting latencies, and find that bugs have diverse reporting latencies. Based on the calculated reporting latencies and features we extract from bugs, we build classification models that can predict whether a bug would be reported early (within 30 days) or later, which may be helpful for prioritizing bug fixing activities.

Inspired from the recently introduced concept of Software as a Service, our research group investigated the concept of Software Analysis as a Service (SOFAS), a distributed and collaborative software analysis platform. SOFAS allows software analyses to be accessed, composed into workflows, and executed over the Internet. However, traditional service composition is a complex, time consuming and error-prone process, which requires experts in both composition languages and existing standards. In this paper, we propose a mashup platform to address the problem of software analysis composition in a light-weight, programming-free process-centric way.

Despite promising results, there are two practical factors that thwart the application of delta debugging: a large number of tests and misleading false positives. In this work, we present a combination of coverage analysis and delta debugging that automatically isolates failure-inducing changes.

Triaging bugs can become a laborious task particularly in open source software (OSS) projects with a large base of comparably inexperienced part-time contributors. In this paper, we propose an efficient and practical method to identify valid bug reports which a) refer to an actual software bug, b) are not duplicates and c) contain enough information to be processed right away. Our classification is based on nine measures to quantify the social embeddedness of bug reporters in the collaboration network. We demonstrate its applicability in a case study, using a comprehensive data set of more than 700, 000 bug reports obtained from the Bugzilla installation of four major OSS communities, for a period of more than ten years. For those projects that exhibit the lowest fraction of valid bug reports, we find that the bug reporters'' position in the collaboration network is a strong indicator for the quality of bug reports. Based on this finding, we develop an automated classification scheme that can easily be integrated into bug tracking platforms and analyze its performance in the considered OSS communities. A support vector machine (SVM) to identify valid bug reports based on the nine measures yields a precision of up to 90.3% with an associated recall of 38.9%. With this, we significantly improve the results obtained in previous case studies for an automated early identification of bugs that are eventually fixed.

Software developers rely on bug reports to fix bugs; thus, bug-tracking tools have been introduced to allow developers to upload, manage, and comment on bug reports to guide corrective software maintenance. However, the very high frequency of duplicate bug reports means that the triagers who help software developers in eliminating bugs must allocate large amounts of time and effort to the identification and analysis of these bug reports. In addition, classifying bug reports can help triagers arrange bugs in categories for the fixers who have more experience for resolving historical bugs in the same category. Unfortunately, due to a large number of submitted bug reports every day, the manual classification for these bug reports increases the triagers'' workload. To resolve these problems, in this study, we develop a novel technique for automatic duplicate detection and classification of bug reports, which reduces the time and effort consumed by triagers for bug fixing. Our novel technique uses a support vector machine to check whether a new bug report is a duplicate. The concept profile is also used to classify the bug reports into related categories in a taxonomic tree. Finally, we conduct experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach using bug reports extracted from the large-scale open source project Mozilla.

However, such tasks require extensive project experience of long term contributors (LTCs). Aim: We measure, understand, and predict how the newcomers'' involvement and environment in the issue tracking system (ITS) affect their odds of becoming an LTC. Method: ITS data of Mozilla and Gnome, literature, interviews, and online documents were used to design measures of involvement and environment. A logistic regression model was used to explain and predict contributor''s odds of becoming an LTC. We also reproduced the results on new data provided by Mozilla. Results: We constructed nine measures of involvement and environment based on events recorded in an ITS. Macro-climate is the overall project environment while micro-climate is person-specific and varies among the participants. Newcomers who are able to get at least one issue reported in the first month to be fixed, doubled their odds of becoming an LTC. The macro-climate with high project popularity and the micro-climate with low attention from peers reduced the odds. The precision of LTC prediction was 38 times higher than for a random predictor. We were able to reproduce the results with new Mozilla data without losing the significance or predictive power of the previously published model. We encountered unexpected changes in some attributes and suggest ways to make analysis of ITS data more reproducible. Conclusions: The findings suggest the importance of initial behaviors and experiences of new participants and outline empirically-based approaches to help the communities with the recruitment of contributors for long-term participation and to help the participants contribute more effectively.

However, these reports widely differ in their quality. We conducted a survey among developers and users of APACHE, ECLIPSE, and MOZILLA to find out what makes a good bug report. The analysis of the 466 responses revealed an information mismatch between what developers need and what users supply. Most developers consider steps to reproduce, stack traces, and test cases as helpful, which are, at the same time, most difficult to provide for users. Such insight is helpful for designing new bug tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more helpful information. Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and measures the quality of new bug reports; it also recommends which elements should be added to improve the quality. We trained CUEZILLA on a sample of 289 bug reports, rated by developers as part of the survey. The participants of our survey also provided 175 comments on hurdles in reporting and resolving bugs. Based on these comments, we discuss several recommendations for better bug tracking systems, which should focus on engaging bug reporters, better tool support, and improved handling of bug duplicates.', NULL, NULL, 'T.

A software project often employs an issue tracking system such as Bugzilla to store and manage their bugs. In the issue tracking system, many bugs are invalid but take unnecessary efforts to identify them. In this paper, we mainly focus on bug fixing rate, i.e., The proportion of the fixed bugs in the reported closed bugs. In particular, we study the characteristics of bug fixing rate and investigate the impact of a reporter''s different contribution behaviors to the bug fixing rate. We perform an empirical study on all reported bugs of two large open source software communities Eclipse and Mozilla. We find (1) the bug fixing rates of both projects are not high, (2) there exhibits a negative correlation between a reporter''s bug fixing rate and the average time cost to close the bugs he/she reports, (3) the amount of bugs a reporter ever fixed has a strong positive impact on his/her bug fixing rate, (4) reporters'' bug fixing rates have no big difference, whether their contribution behaviors concentrate on a few products or across many products, (5) reporters'' bug fixing rates tend to increase as time goes on, i.e., Developers become more experienced at reporting bugs.', NULL, NULL, 'W.
