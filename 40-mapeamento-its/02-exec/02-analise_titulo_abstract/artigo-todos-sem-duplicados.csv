"Ahmadi2015";"SMALL DIM OBJECT TRACKING USING A MULTI OBJECTIVE PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMISATION TECHNIQUE";"K. Ahmadi and E. Salari";"Dim object tracking in a heavy clutter environment is a theoretical and technological challenge in the field of image processing. For a small dim object, conventional tracking methods fail for the lack of geometrical information. Multiple hypotheses testing (MHT) is one of the generally accepted methods in target tracking systems. However, processing a tree structure with a significant number of branches in MHT has been a challenging issue. Tracking high-speed objects with traditional MHT requires some presumptions which limit the capabilities of these methods. This study presents a hierarchal tracking system in two levels to solve this problem. For each point in the lower-level, a multi objective particle swarm optimisation technique is applied to a group of consecutive frames to reduce the number of branches in each tracking tree. Thus, an optimum track for each moving object is obtained in a group of frames. In the upper-level, an iterative process is used to connect the matching optimum tracks of the consecutive frames based on the spatial information and fitness values. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a superior performance in relation to some common dim object tracking methods over different image sequence data sets.";"";"article"

"An2014";"SUPPLEMENTARY BUG FIXES VS. RE-OPENED BUGS";"L. An and F. Khomh and B. Adams";"A typical bug fixing cycle involves the reporting of a bug, the triaging of the report, the production and verification of a fix, and the closing of the bug. However, previous work has studied two phenomena where more than one fix are associated with the same bug report. The first one is the case where developers re-open a previously fixed bug in the bug repository (sometimes even multiple times) to provide a new bug fix that replace a previous fix, whereas the second one is the case where multiple commits in the version control system contribute to the same bug report (\""supplementary bug fixes\""). Even though both phenomena seem related, they have never been studied together, i.e., are supplementary fixes a subset of re-opened bugs or the other way around? This paper investigates the interplay between both phenomena in five open source software projects: Mozilla, Net beans, Eclipse JDT Core, Eclipse Platform SWT, and Web Kit. We found that re-opened bugs account for between 21.6% and 33.8% of all supplementary fixes. However, 33% to 57.5% of re-opened bugs had only one commit associated, which means that the original bug report was prematurely closed instead of fixed incorrectly. Furthermore, we constructed predictive models for re-opened bugs using historical information about supplementary bug fixes with a precision between 72.2% and 97%, as well as a recall between 47.7% and 65.3%. Software researchers and practitioners who are mining data repositories can use our approach to identify potential failures of their bug fixes and the re-opening of bug reports.";"Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM), 2014 IEEE 14th International Working Conference on";"inproceedings"
"Antoniol2005";"TOWARDS THE INTEGRATION OF VERSIONING SYSTEMS, BUG REPORTS AND SOURCE CODE META-MODELS";"Antoniol, G.a and Di Penta, M.a and Gall, H.b and Pinzger, M.c ";"Versioning system repositories and bug tracking systems are valuable sources of information to study the evolution of large open source software systems. However, being conceived for specific purposes, i.e., to support the development or trigger maintenance activities, they do neither allow an easy information browsing nor support the study of software evolution. For example, queries such as locating and browsing the faultiest methods are not provided. This paper addresses such issues and proposes an approach and a framework to consistently merge information extracted from source code, versioning repositories and bug reports. Our information representation exploits the property concepts of the FAMIX information exchange meta-model, allowing to represent, browse, and query, at different level of abstractions, the concept of interest. This allows the user to navigate back and forth from versioning system modification reports to bug reports and to source code. This paper presents the analysis framework and approaches to populate it, tools developed and under development for it, as well as lessons learned while analyzing several releases of Mozilla. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.";"";"article"

Developers already have a variety of specialty tools to support task management, for example, issue tracking and configuration management software, but they also make use of other tools within their software engineering environments to support software task management. An example of one such mechanism is the appropriation of source code comments to document finer grained details of formally specified tasks. In this research, we propose and present a tool that integrates these source code annotations with an issue tracking management system. We describe how this tool addresses deficiencies that occur in task management and propose future research to improve task management.";"Software Maintenance, 2008. ICSM 2008.

These prioritized requirements have been characterized and are annually reconciled in terms of gaps associated with required analysis cycle-times, physical accuracy, and necessary analysis capabilities. Furthermore, the Office of the Secretary of Defense(OSD) Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) has provided goals which drive the usage of CREATE software by DoD Acquisition Programs. In order to achieve these usage targets, the CREATE Program has established a governance model and thence a hosted set of services to enhance collaboration among the developer teams and the targeted Acquisition Program (AP) subject matter experts. The goals of these collaboration services are to: 1) scale and speed the feedback amongst the CREATE and AP teams, while 2) minimizing interruption to developer and user workflows. Towards these goals, the community services have been architected as discussion forums, issue tracking, and documentation. Such services are now common place in the enterprise and open-source software projects, and efficiently scale with the user community by enabling a searchable knowledge base. In addition, owing to the key capabilities of this DoD software, CREATE requires authenticated and authorized access for each member of the community. This paper summarizes the governance model and process by which the services were selected, the architecture implemented, and the challenges going forward.";"High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference (HPCMP-UGC), 2010 DoD";"inproceedings"
"Azarbakht2014";"TEMPORAL VISUALIZATION OF COLLABORATIVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN FOSS FORKS";"A. Azarbakht";"Software development in free and open source (FOSS) projects is a collective human activity. Software developers in these projects collaborate via FOSS informalisms, i.e. mailing list, bug repository and code repository. Analysing the human collaborative work of these software developers over a time period, e.g. five years, sheds light on the underlying structure and dynamics of how the software is being developed, how the project is led, who the influencers are, and how to achieve a state of sustainability. In this paper, we propose to use temporal social network analysis with temporal visualization to study the evolution and social dynamics of FOSS communities. With these techniques we aim to identify measures associated with unhealthy group dynamics, e.g. a simmering conflict, as well as early indicators of major events in the lifespan of a community. One dynamic we are especially interested in, are those of forked FOSS projects. We used the results of a study of forked FOSS projects by [Robles and Gonzalez-Barahona 2012] as the starting platform for our study, and tried to gain a better understanding of the evolution of these communities.";"2014 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)";"inproceedings"

"Banerjee2015";"ON THE COST OF MINING VERY LARGE OPEN SOURCE REPOSITORIES";"S. Banerjee and B. Cukic";"Open source bug tracking systems provide a rich information suite that is actively used by software engineering researchers to design solutions to triaging, duplicate classification and developer assignment problems. Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the “big-dataism”. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources. In an ideal situation, with no bottlenecks, a researcher investing just over $40, 000 and 2 weeks of non stop computing time would be able to measure similarity of problem reports within all four datasets.";"Big Data Software Engineering (BIGDSE), 2015 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on";"inproceedings"

Cukic";"Bug tracking systems play an important role in the development and maintenance of large-scale software systems. Having access to open source bug tracking systems has allowed researchers to take advantage of rich datasets and propose solutions to manage duplicate report classification, developer assignment and quality assessment. In spite of research advances, our understanding of the content of these repositories remains limited, primarily because of their size. In many cases, researchers analyze small portions of datasets thus limiting the understanding of the dynamics of problem reporting. The objective of this study is to explore the properties of two large-scale open source problem report repositories. The Eclipse dataset, at the time of download, consisted of 363; 770 reports spanning 11+ years, whereas Mozilla contained 699; 085 reports spanning 14+ years.Our research examines the evolution of datasets over time by analyzing the changes in the repository and the profiles of users who submit problem reports. We provide quantitative evidence on how submitter's maturity reduces the propensity to submit poor quality, insignificant or duplicate reports. We show that a diverse user base, characteristic of Mozilla, creates challenges for the development team as they spend more time triaging, rather than fixing, issues. Finally, we provide the research community with a series of observations and suggestions on how to study large-scale problem repositories.";"2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on High Assurance Systems Engineering";"inproceedings"

Developer interactions through commenting on bug reports generate a developer social network that can be used to improve software development and maintenance activities. In large scale complex software projects, software maintenance requires larger groups to participate in its activities. Most previous bug assignments approaches assign only one developer to new bugs. However, bug fixing is a collaborative effort between several developers (i.e., many developers contribute their experience in fixing a bug report). In this work, we build developers social networks based on developers comments on bug reports and detect developers communities. We also assign a relevant community to each newly committed bug report. Moreover, we rank developers in each community based on their experience. An experimental evaluation is conducted on three open source projects namely Net Beans, Free desktop, and Mandriva. The results show that the detected communities are significantly connected with high density. They also show that the proposed approach achieves feasible accuracy of bug assignment.";"Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 2013 12th International Conference on";"inproceedings"

Godfrey";"When submitting a patch, the primary concerns of individual developers are “How can I maximize the chances of my patch being approved, and minimize the time it takes for this to happen?” In principle, code review is a transparent process that aims to assess qualities of the patch by their technical merits and in a timely manner; however, in practice the execution of this process can be affected by a variety of factors, some of which are external to the technical content of the patch itself. In this paper, we describe an empirical study of the code review process for WebKit, a large, open source project; we replicate the impact of previously studied factors - such as patch size, priority, and component and extend these studies by investigating organizational (the company) and personal dimensions (reviewer load and activity, patch writer experience) on code review response time and outcome. Our approach uses a reverse engineered model of the patch submission process and extracts key information from the issue tracking and code review systems. Our findings suggest that these nontechnical factors can significantly impact code review outcomes.";"2013 20th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE)";"inproceedings"

However, these reports widely differ in their quality. We conducted a survey among developers and users of APACHE, ECLIPSE, and MOZILLA to find out what makes a good bug report. The analysis of the 466 responses revealed an information mismatch between what developers need and what users supply. Most developers consider steps to reproduce, stack traces, and test cases as helpful, which are at the same time most difficult to provide for users. Such insight is helpful to design new bug tracking tools that guide users at collecting and providing more helpful information. Our CUEZILLA prototype is such a tool and measures the quality of new bug reports; it also recommends which elements should be added to improve the quality. We trained CUEZILLA on a sample of 289 bug reports, rated by developers as part of the survey. In our experiments, CUEZILLA was able to predict the quality of 31 - 48% of bug reports accurately. &copy; 2008 ACM.";"";"inproceedings"

We introduce In Situ Impact Insight (I3), a novel user interface to support feature location. In addition to a list of search results, I3 provides support for developers during browsing and inspecting the retrieved code entities. In situ visualizations augment results and source code with additional information relevant for further exploration. Developers are able to retrieve details on the textual similarity of a source code entity to the search query and to other entities, as well as the information on co-changed entities from a project's history. Execution traces recorded during program runs can be used as filters to further refine the search results. We implemented I3 as an Eclipse plug-in and tested it in a user study involving 18 students and professional developers that were asked to perform three feature location tasks chosen from the issue tracking system of jEdit. The results of our study suggest that I3's user interface is intuitive and unobtrusively supports developers with the required information when and where they need it.";"2015 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Program Comprehension";"inproceedings"

Neumann";"Researchers in the IS domain have addressed communication structure and its effect on performance. While early research focused on small networks and utilized sociometric surveys, recent works have concentrated on electronic data sources provided by open source software repositories. Surprisingly, software vendors have less frequently been studied despite their need for continuous enhancement of organizational design. In this study, we analyze a global business software vendor by utilizing existing data sources. We investigate the association of both collaboration network centrality and communication with process efficiency. Despite coping with complex, interweaved processes and social networks, we find that communication, centrality in the large case-study-wide network, and communication pattern homogeneity are positively associated with process efficiency. However, centrality in small work groups slows the analyzed issue tracking process down, possibly due to increased overhead and bottleneck effects that become visible when looking at single issues qualitatively.";"System Sciences (HICSS), 2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on";"inproceedings"

We performed experiments on bug report repositories of bug tracking systems such as bugzilla and debugger. In the proposed approach we apply text mining methodology and TF-IDF on the existing historic bug report database based on the bug s description to predict the nature of the bug and to train a statistical model for manually mislabeled bug reports present in the database. The tool helps in deciding the priorities of the incoming bugs depending on the category of the bugs i.e. whether it is a security bug report or a non-security bug report, using naïve bayes. Our evaluation shows that our tool using TF-IDF is giving better results than the naïve bayes method. © 2014 IEEE.";"";"conference"

Developers would then fix some of the bugs and commit corresponding code changes into version control systems such as svn or git. Unfortunately, the links between bug reports and code changes are missing for many software projects as the bug tracking and version control systems are often maintained separately. Yet, linking bug reports to fix commits is important as it could shed light into the nature of bug fixing processes and expose patterns in software management. Bug linking solutions, such as ReLink, have been proposed. The demonstration of their effectiveness however faces a number of issues, including a reliability issue with their ground truth datasets as well as the extent of their measurements. We propose in this study a benchmark for evaluating bug linking solutions. This benchmark includes a dataset of about 12,000 bug links from 10 programs. These true links between bug reports and their fixes have been provided during bug fixing processes. We designed a number of research questions, to assess both quantitatively and qualitatively the effectiveness of a bug linking tool. Finally, we apply this benchmark on ReLink to report the strengths and limitations of this bug linking tool. © 2013 IEEE.";"";"conference"
"Boisselle2015";"THE IMPACT OF CROSS-DISTRIBUTION BUG DUPLICATES, EMPIRICAL STUDY ON DEBIAN AND UBUNTU";"V. Boisselle and B. Adams";"Although open source distributions like Debian and Ubuntu are closely related, sometimes a bug reported in the Debian bug repository is reported independently in the Ubuntu repository as well, without the Ubuntu users nor developers being aware. Such cases of undetected cross-distribution bug duplicates can cause developers and users to lose precious time working on a fix that already exists or to work individually instead of collaborating to find a fix faster. We perform a case study on Ubuntu and Debian bug repositories to measure the amount of cross-distribution bug duplicates and estimate the amount of time lost. By adapting an existing within-project duplicate detection approach (achieving a similar recall of 60%), we find 821 cross-duplicates. The early detection of such duplicates could reduce the time lost by users waiting for a fix by a median of 38 days. Furthermore, we estimate that developers from the different distributions lose a median of 47 days in which they could have collaborated together, had they been aware of duplicates. These results show the need to detect and monitor cross-distribution duplicates.";"Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM), 2015 IEEE 15th International Working Conference on";"inproceedings"

However, keeping maintenance activities and their related artifacts on track comes at a high cost. In this respect, change request (CR) repositories are fundamental in software maintenance. They facilitate the management of CRs and are also the central point to coordinate activities and communication among stakeholders. However, the benefits of CR repositories do not come without issues, and commonly occurring ones should be dealt with, such as the following: duplicate CRs, the large number of CRs to assign, or poorly described CRs. Such issues have led researchers to an increased interest in investigating CR repositories, by considering different aspects of software development and CR management. In this paper, we performed a systematic mapping study to characterize this research field. We analyzed 142 studies, which we classified in two ways.

Upadhyaya";"Given the large number of vulnerability instances disclosed in various bug-tracking communities, system administrators face an up-hill task of protecting their system/ network against zero-day exploits. In order to safeguard against such exploits, the present challenges come in two-fold: (i) there exists a compelling need to assimilate configuration specific vulnerability information from various bug-tracking diaspora; also (ii) there is a need to proactively generate policy specific signatures which act as a first line of defense. In this paper we propose an automated approach for determining vulnerabilities pertinent to the current network/ system configuration using the information aggregated from different bug tracking communities. Such vulnerability assessment and indication mechanisms significantly alleviate the system administratorÂ¿s burden of manual content digging for vulnerabilities in his own configuration context. Furthermore, we propose an Extensible Defense Oriented Representation Schema (EDORS) for vulnerability representation, which is subsequently used by the policy engine to generate appropriate signatures. As a result, the generated signatures can be viewed as a preventive interim security measure against recently published threats until its patch is released. We have also evaluated our framework through a series of experiments.";"Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops, 2007, AINAW '07. 21st International Conference on";"inproceedings"

Identification of severity level can be useful for bug triager in allocating the bug to the concerned bug fixer. Various researchers have attempted text mining techniques in predicting the severity of bugs, detection of duplicate bug reports and assignment of bugs to suitable fixer for its fix. In this paper, an attempt has been made to compare the performance of different machine learning techniques namely Support vector machine (SVM), probability based Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree based J48 (A Java implementation of C4.5), rule based Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) and Random Forests (RF) learners in predicting the severity level (1 to 5) of a reported bug by analyzing the summary or short description of the bug reports. The bug report data has been taken from NASA's PITS (Projects and Issue Tracking System) datasets as closed source and components of Eclipse, Mozilla & GNOME datasets as open source projects. The analysis has been carried out in RapidMiner and STATISTICA data mining tools.

One reason for growing bug reports is that bug reporters do not browse the bug repository before submitting a bug report. There may be some similar bugs already reported: one, which are exactly similar or duplicate and other, which are semantically similar means they may belong to the same software component or files. The information contained in the previously reported similar bugs can be helpful in fixing and resolving the newly reported bugs. In this paper, we applied and compared performance of two information retrieval (IR) models: Vector Space Model (VSM) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), in extracting existing similar bug reports. The performance of these two models have been evaluated based on the Top Ten results retrieved by them for relevant bug reports.

Then the bug is described as a bug report, which is submitted to a bug repository. Finally the bug triager checks the bug report and typically assigns a developer to fix the bug. The assignment process is time-consuming and error-prone. Furthermore, a large number of bug reports are tossed (reassigned) to other developers, which increases bug-fix time. In order to quickly identify the fixer to bug reports we present an approach based on the bug tossing history and textual similarities between bug reports. This proposed approach is evaluated on Eclipse and Mozilla.

Existing approaches to recover links between a bug and the methods changed to fix the bug rely on the presence of the bug's identifier in a CVS log message. In this paper we present an approach that relies instead on the presence of a patch in the issue report for the bug. That is, rather than analyzing deltas retrieved from CVS to recover links, our approach analyzes patches retrieved from Bugzilla. We use BugTrace, the tool implementing our approach, to conduct a case study in which we compare the links recovered by our approach to links recovered by manual inspection.

Several support tools such as issue tracking, code review and Source Control Management (SCM) systems have been introduced in the past decades to ease development activities. While such tools efficiently track the evolution of a given aspect of the project (e.g., bug reports), they provide just a partial view of the project and often lack of advanced querying mechanisms limiting themselves to command line or simple GUI support. This is particularly true for projects that rely on Git, the most popular SCM system today. In this paper, we propose a conceptual schema for Git and an approach that, given a Git repository, exports its data to a relational database in order to (1) promote data integration with other existing SCM tools and (2) enable writing queries on Git data using standard SQL syntax. To ensure efficiency, our approach comes with an incremental propagation mechanism that refreshes the database content with the latest modifications.

Understanding the evolution of large software systems is a complex problem, which requires the use of various techniques and the support of tools. Several software evolution approaches put the emphasis on structural entities such as packages, classes and structural relationships. However, software evolution is not only about the history of software artifacts, but it also includes other types of data such as problem reports, mailing list archives etc. We propose an approach which focuses on historical dependencies and defects. We claim that they play an important role in software evolution and they are complementary to techniques based on structural information. We use historical dependencies and defect information to learn about a software system and detect potential problems in the source code. Moreover, based on design flaws detected in the source code, we predict the location of future bugs to focus maintenance activities on the buggy parts of the system. We validated our defect prediction by comparing it with the actual defects reported in the bug tracking system.";"Software Maintenance, 2008. ICSM 2008.

Despite their usefulness, a common downside of such tools is that their use comes with many strings attached, such as installation, data formats, usability, etc. The result is that many tools are only used by their creators, which is detrimental to cross-fertilization of research ideas and collaborative analysis. In this paper we present the Churrasco framework, which supports software evolution modeling, visualization and analysis through a web interface. The user provides only the URL of the Subversion repository to be analyzed and, if available, of the corresponding bug tracking system. Churrasco processes the given data and automatically creates and stores an evolutionary model in a centralized database. This database, called Meta-base is connected to Churrasco through object-relational persistence. The persistency mechanism is meta-described in terms of the EMOF meta-meta- model and automatically generated based on any given evolutionary meta-model. In case the meta-model changes, the persistency mechanism is automatically updated. After providing a detailed description of Churrasco, we provide evidence, by means of an example scenario, that it allows for collaborative software evolution analysis, based on visualizations available on our analysis web portal.";"Software Maintenance and Reengineering, 2008.

Unfortunately, this information is not usually recorded when fixing bugs, and recovering it later is challenging. Recently, the text approach and the dependence approach have been developed to tackle this problem. Respectively, they examine textual and dependence-related changes that occurred prior to a bug fix. However, only limited evaluation has been carried out, partially because of a lack of available implementations and of datasets linking bugs to origins. To address this, origins of 174 bugs in three projects were manually identified and compared to a simulation of the approaches. Both approaches were partially successful across a variety of bugs - achieving 29-79% precision and 40-70% recall. Results suggested the precise definition of program dependence could affect performance, as could whether the approaches identified a single or multiple origins. Some potential improvements are explored in detail and identify pragmatic strategies for combining techniques along with simple modifications. Even after adopting these improvements, there remain many challenges: large commits, unrelated changes and long periods between origins and fixes all reduce effectiveness.

Xie";"Online service systems have been increasingly popular and important nowadays, with an increasing demand on the availability of services provided by these systems, while significant efforts have been made to strive for keeping services up continuously. Therefore, reducing the MTTR (Mean Time to Restore) of a service remains the most important step to assure the user-perceived availability of the service. To reduce the MTTR, a common practice is to restore the service by identifying and applying an appropriate healing action (i.e., a temporary workaround action such as rebooting a SQL machine). However, manually identifying an appropriate healing action for a given new issue (such as service down) is typically time consuming and error prone. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present an automated mining-based approach for suggesting an appropriate healing action for a given new issue. Our approach generates signatures of an issue from its corresponding transaction logs and then retrieves historical issues from a historical issue repository. Finally, our approach suggests an appropriate healing action by adapting healing actions for the retrieved historical issues. We have implemented a healing suggestion system for our approach and applied it to a real-world product online service that serves millions of online customers globally. The studies on 77 incidents (severe issues) over 3 months showed that our approach can effectively provide appropriate healing actions to reduce the MTTR of the service.";"Automated Software Engineering (ASE), 2012 Proceedings of the 27th IEEE/ACM International Conference on";"inproceedings"

Our case study builds on extensive data sets from the project's bug tracking platform BUGZILLA, to quantify the activity of contributors, and its mail archives, to quantify the emotions of contributors by means of sentiment analysis. The GENTOO project is known for a period of centralization within its bug triaging community. This was followed by considerable changes in community organization and performance after the sudden retirement of the central contributor. We analyze how this event correlates with the negative emotions, both in bilateral email discussions with the central contributor, and at the level of the whole community of contributors. We then extend our study to consider the activity patterns of GENTOO contributors in general. We find that contributors are more likely to become inactive when they express strong positive or negative emotions in the bug tracker, or when they deviate from the expected value of emotions in the mailing list. We use these insights to develop a Bayesian classifier that detects the risk of contributors leaving the project. Our analysis opens new perspectives for measuring online contributor motivation by means of sentiment analysis and for real-time predictions of contributor turnover in Open Source Software projects.";"Cloud and Green Computing (CGC), 2013 Third International Conference on";"inproceedings"
"Felderer2015";"USING DEFECT TAXONOMIES FOR TESTING REQUIREMENTS";"M. Felderer and A. Beer";"Systematic defect management based on bug-tracking systems such as Bugzilla is well established and has been successfully used in many software organizations. Defect management weights the failures observed during test execution according to their severity and forms the basis for effective defect taxonomies. In practice, most defect taxonomies are used only for the a posteriori allocation of testing resources to prioritize failures for debugging. Thus, these taxonomies' full potential to control and improve all the steps of testing has remained unexploited. This is especially the case for testing a system's user requirements. System-level defect taxonomies can improve the design of requirements-based tests, the tracing of defects to requirements, the quality assessment of requirements, and the control of the relevant defect management. So, we developed requirements-based testing with defect taxonomies (RTDT). This approach is aligned with the standard test process and uses defect taxonomies to support all phases of testing requirements. To illustrate this approach and its benefits, we use an example project (which we call Project A) from a public health insurance institution.";"";"article"

However, duplicate bug reports tend to result in waste of resources, and may cause potential conflicts. There have been two types of works focusing on this problem: relevant bug report retrieval [8][11][10][13] and duplicate bug report identification [5][12]. The former methods can achieve high accuracy (82%) in the top 10 results in some dataset, but they do not really reduce the workload of developers. The latter methods still need further improvement on the performance. In this paper, we propose a practical duplicate bug reports detection method, which aims to help project team to reduce their workload by combining existing two categories of methods. We also propose some new features extracted from comments, user profiles and query feedback, which are useful for improving the detection performance.

Xie";"A bug-tracking system such as Bugzilla contains bug reports (BRs) collected from various sources such as development teams, testing teams, and end users. When bug reporters submit bug reports to a bug-tracking system, the bug reporters need to label the bug reports as security bug reports (SBRs) or not, to indicate whether the involved bugs are security problems. These SBRs generally deserve higher priority in bug fixing than not-security bug reports (NSBRs). However, in the bug-reporting process, bug reporters often mislabel SBRs as NSBRs partly due to lack of security domain knowledge. This mislabeling could cause serious damage to software-system stakeholders due to the induced delay of identifying and fixing the involved security bugs. To address this important issue, we developed a new approach that applies text mining on natural-language descriptions of BRs to train a statistical model on already manually-labeled BRs to identify SBRs that are manually-mislabeled as NSBRs. Security engineers can use the model to automate the classification of BRs from large bug databases to reduce the time that they spend on searching for SBRs. We evaluated the model's predictions on a large Cisco software system with over ten million source lines of code. Among a sample of BRs that Cisco bug reporters manually labeled as NSBRs in bug reporting, our model successfully classified a high percentage (78%) of the SBRs as verified by Cisco security engineers, and predicted their classification as SBRs with a probability of at least 0.98.";"2010 7th IEEE Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2010)";"inproceedings"

A myriad of analyses exploiting that data have been proposed throughout the years: source code analysis, code duplication analysis, co-change analysis, bug prediction, or detection of bug fixing patterns. However, easy and straight forward synergies between these analyses rarely exist. To tackle this problem we have developed SOFA S, a distributed and collaborative software analysis platform to enable a seamless interoperation of such analyses. In particular, software analyses are offered as RESTful web services that can be accessed and composed over the Internet. SOFA S services are accessible through a software analysis catalog where any project stakeholder can, depending on the needs or interests, pick specific analyses, combine them, let them run remotely and then fetch the final results. That way, software developers, testers, architects, or quality assurance experts are given access to quality analysis services. They are shielded from many peculiarities of tool installations and configurations, but SOFA S offers them sophisticated and easy-to-use analyses.

Smith's Weblog Many programs purport to help a development team manage a projectbut most of them aren't very good. Enter FogBugz. This dynamic tool is based on keeping track of a database of cases. At any given time, cases are assigned to one person, who must resolve or forward them to someone else. With FogBugz, cases can be prioritized, documented, sorted, discussed, edited, assigned, estimated, searched, and tracked. And because FogBugz is web-based, everyone on a development team has access to the whole picture, at any given moment. That picture may include everything from customer feature requests, to high-level design discussions, to tiny bug fix details. This book (written under the guidance of the entire FogBugz team) completely describes the ins and outs of the latest version of FogBugz. Copyright © 2005 by Mike Gunderloy.

"Gupta2014a";"PROCESS CUBE FOR SOFTWARE DEFECT RESOLUTION";"Gupta, M. and Sureka, A.";"Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) cube is a multi-dimensional dataset used for analyzing data in a Data Warehouse (DW) for the purpose of extracting actionable intelligence. Process mining consists of analyzing event log data produced from Process Aware Information Systems (PAIS) for the purpose of discovering and improving business processes. Process cube is a concept which falls at the intersection of OLAP cube and process mining. Process cube facilitates process mining from multiple-dimensions and enables comparison of process mining results across various dimensions. We present an application of process cube to software defect resolution process to analyze and compare process data from a multi-dimensional perspective. We present a framework, a novel perspective to mine software repositories using process cube. Each cell of process cube is defined by metrics from multiple process mining perspectives like control flow, time, conformance and organizational perspective. We conduct a case-study on Google Chromium project data in which the software defect resolution process spans three software repositories: Issue Tracking System (ITS), Peer Code Review System (PCR) and Version Control System (VCS). We define process cube with 9 dimensions as issue report timestamp, priority, state, closed status, OS, component, bug type, reporter and owner. We define hierarchies along various dimensions and cluster members to handle sparsity. We apply OLAP cube operations such as slice, dice, roll-up and drill-down, and create materialized sublog for each cell. We demonstrate the solution approach by discovering process map and compare process mining results from control flow and time perspective for Performance and Security issues. © 2014 IEEE.";"";"conference"

Researchers investigated mailing lists considering them as a hub for project communication. Prior work focused on specific aspects of emails, for example the handling of patches, traceability concerns, or social networks. This led to insights pertaining to the investigated aspects, but not to a comprehensive view of what developers communicate about. Our objective is to increase the understanding of development mailing lists communication. We quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed a sample of 506 email threads from the development mailing list of a major OSS project, Lucene. Our investigation reveals that implementation details are discussed only in about 35% of the threads, and that a range of other topics is discussed. Moreover, core developers participate in less than 75% of the threads. We observed that the development mailing list is not the main player in OSS project communication, as it also includes other channels such as the issue repository.";"Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 2013 10th IEEE Working Conference on";"inproceedings"
"Gyimesi2015";"CHARACTERIZATION OF SOURCE CODE DEFECTS BY DATA MINING CONDUCTED ON GITHUB";"Gyimesi, P. and Gyimesi, G. and Tóth, Z. and Ferenc, R.";"In software systems the coding errors are unavoidable due to the frequent source changes, the tight deadlines and the inaccurate specifications. Therefore, it is important to have tools that help us in finding these errors. One way of supporting bug prediction is to analyze the characteristics of the previous errors and identify the unknown ones based on these characteristics. This paper aims to characterize the known coding errors. Nowadays, the popularity of the source code hosting services like GitHub are increasing rapidly. They provide a variety of services, among which the most important ones are the version and bug tracking systems. Version control systems store all versions of the source code, and bug tracking systems provide a unified interface for reporting errors. Bug reports can be used to identify the wrong and the previously fixed source code parts, thus the bugs can be characterized by static source code metrics or by other quantitatively measured properties using the gathered data. We chose GitHub for the base of data collection and we selected 13 Java projects for analysis. As a result, a database was constructed, which characterizes the bugs of the examined projects, thus can be used, inter alia, to improve the automatic detection of software defects. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.";"";"article"

Bener";"The bug tracking repositories of software projects capture initial defect (bug) reports and the history of interactions among developers, testers, and customers. Extracting and mining information from these repositories is time consuming and daunting. Researchers have focused mostly on analyzing the frequency of the occurrence of defects and their attributes (e.g., The number of comments and lines of code changed, count of developers). However, the counting process eliminates information about the temporal alignment of events leading to changes in the attributes count. Software quality teams could plan and prioritize their work more efficiently if they were aware of these temporal sequences and knew their frequency of occurrence. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset mined from the Fire fox bug repository (Bugzilla) which contains information about the temporal alignment of developer interactions. Our dataset covers eight years of data from the Fire fox project on activities throughout the project's lifecycle. Some of these activities have not been reported in frequency-based or other temporal datasets. The dataset we mined from the Fire fox project contains new activities, such as reporter experience, file exchange events, code-review process activities, and setting of milestones. We believe that this new dataset will improve analysis of bug reports and enable mining of temporal relationships so that practitioners can enhance their bug-fixing process.";"2015 IEEE/ACM 12th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories";"inproceedings"

In fact, view-based models - called also partial models - are manipulated by different actors (designers), and are thus generally heterogeneous, that is, described with different DSLs (Domain Specific Languages). Instead of building a single global model, which is not realistic, we propose to organize the different partial models as a network of related models, which provides a global view of the system through a correspondence model. As models are modelled separately by different designers, they also evolve separately that induces a problem of consistency. To solve it, we propose a semi-automatic process based on the correspondence model allowing detecting changes, calculating their impacts, and proposing modifications to maintain the consistency among them. The approach is supported by a tool chain and illustrated by the example of a Bug Tracking System.";"2014 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)";"inproceedings"

"Hindle2016";"A CONTEXTUAL APPROACH TOWARDS MORE ACCURATE DUPLICATE BUG REPORT DETECTION AND RANKING";"Hindle, A. and Alipour, A. and Stroulia, E.";"The issue-tracking systems used by software projects contain issues, bugs, or tickets written by a wide variety of bug reporters, with different levels of training and knowledge about the system under development. Typically, reporters lack the skills and/or time to search the issue-tracking system for similar issues already reported. As a result, many reports end up referring to the same issue, which effectively makes the bug-report triaging process time consuming and error prone. Many researchers have approached the bug-deduplication problem using off-the-shelf information-retrieval (IR) tools. In this work, we extend the state of the art by investigating how contextual information about software-quality attributes, software-architecture terms, and system-development topics can be exploited to improve bug deduplication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our contextual bug-deduplication method at ranking duplicates on the bug repositories of the Android, Eclipse, Mozilla, and OpenOffice software systems. Based on this experience, we conclude that taking into account domain-specific context can improve IR methods for bug deduplication. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.";"";"article"

Little is known about the evolutionary behavior, lifetime, distribution, and stability of bugs. In this paper, we propose to consider bugs as first class entities and a useful source of information that can answer such topics. Such analysis is inherently complex, because bugs are intangible, invisible, and difficult to be traced. Therefore, our tool extracts information about bugs from bug tracking systems, link this information to other software artifacts, and explore interactive visualizations of bugs that we call bug maps.";"Software Maintenance and Reengineering (CSMR), 2012 16th European Conference on";"inproceedings"

In GitHub, the largest code hosting service for OSS, this feedback is typically expressed as new issues for the project managed by an issue-tracking system available in each new project repository. Among other features, the issue tracker allows creating and assigning labels to issues with the goal of helping the project community to better classify and manage those issues (e.g., facilitating the identification of issues for top priority components or candidate developers that could solve them). Nevertheless, as the project grows a manual browsing of the project issues is no longer feasible. In this paper we present GiLA, a tool which generates a set of visualizations to facilitate the analysis of issues in a project depending on their label-based categorization. We believe our visualizations are useful to see the most popular labels (and their relationships) in a project, identify the most active community members for those labels and compare the typical issue evolution for each label category.";"2015 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER)";"inproceedings"
"Jalbert2008a";"AUTOMATED DUPLICATE DETECTION FOR BUG TRACKING SYSTEMS";"Jalbert, N. and Weimer, W.";"Bug tracking systems are important tools that guide the maintenance activities of software developers. The utility of these systems is hampered by an excessive number of duplicate bug reports-in some projects as many as a quarter of all reports are duplicates. Developers must manually identify duplicate bug reports, but this identification process is time-consuming and exacerbates the already high cost of software maintenance. We propose a system that automatically classifies duplicate bug reports as they arrive to save developer time. This system uses surface features, textual semantics, and graph clustering to predict duplicate status. Using a dataset of 29,000 bug reports from the Mozilla project, we perform experiments that include a simulation of a real-time bug reporting environment. Our system is able to reduce development cost by filtering out 8% of duplicate bug reports while allowing at least one report for each real defect to reach developers. © 2008 IEEE.";"";"conference"

Our study consists of two experiments of automatic bug assignment, using Chinese text and the other non-text information of bug data respectively. Based on text data of the bug repository, the first experiment uses SVM to predict bug assignments and achieve accuracy close to that by human triagers. The second one explores the usefulness of non-text data in making such prediction.

"Kaushik2012";"A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE PERFORMANCE OF IR MODELS ON DUPLICATE BUG DETECTION";"N. Kaushik and L.

One of the tasks of a triager is to identify whether an incoming bug report is a duplicate of a pre-existing report. In order to detect duplicate bug reports, a triager either relies on his memory and experience or on the search capabilities of the bug repository. Both these approaches can be time consuming for the triager and may also lead to the misidentification of duplicates. In the literature, several approaches to automate duplicate bug report detection have been proposed. However, there has not been an exhaustive comparison of the performance of different IR models, especially with topic-based ones such as LSI and LDA. In this paper, we compare the performance of the traditional vector space model (using different weighting schemes) with that of topic based models, leveraging heuristics that incorporate exception stack frames, surface features, summary and long description from the free-form text in the bug report. We perform experiments on subsets of bug reports from Eclipse and Firefox and achieve a recall rate of 60% and 58% respectively. We find that word-based models, in particular a Log-Entropy based weighting scheme, outperform topic based ones such as LSI, LDA and Random Projections. Our findings also suggests that for the problem of duplicate bug detection, it is important to consider a project's domain and characteristics to devise a set of heuristics to achieve optimal results.";"Software Maintenance and Reengineering (CSMR), 2012 16th European Conference on";"inproceedings"

Such teams often use online tools such as mailing lists, bug tracking systems or online discussion forums to communicate, clarify or coordinate work on requirements. In this kind of environment, the expected evolution from initial idea, through clarification, to a stable requirement, often stagnates. When project managers are not aware of underlying problems, development may proceed before requirements are fully understood and stabilized, leading to numerous implementation issues and often resulting in the need for early redesign and modification. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing online requirements communication and a method for the detection and classification of clarification events in requirement discussions. We used our approach to analyze online requirements communication in the IBM® Rational Team Concert® (RTC) project and identified a set of six clarification patterns. Since a predominant amount of clarifications through the lifetime of a requirement is often indicative of problematic requirements, our approach lends support to project managers to assess, in real-time, the state of discussions around a requirement and promptly react to requirements problems.";"2012 20th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE)";"inproceedings"

We analyze issue tracking data of a large corporation containing task descriptions and assignments to people that were computed manually. We identify several entities and concepts from the dataset and build a co-occurrence graph as the basic data structure for computing deep matches.

Through our experience in teaching communication theories in CS456/556, a software engineering course at Ohio University, we observed that when communication theories are delivered in traditional methods such as lectures without additional exercises designed for students to apply the theories, many students tend to treat them as an independent part of the course and continue to guide their behaviors in team activities with their old habits and preexisting intuitions. We found that issue tracking tools can help facilitate student learning of communication skills by forcing students to explicitly carry out effective steps recommended by communication theories and thus improve communications among students. Moreover, issue tracking tools also improve communications between the students and the instructor, and enable the instructor to be more aware of team status, detect team problems early on, and reply less on time-consuming and often inaccurate in-class team status reports";"18th Conference on Software Engineering Education Training (CSEET'05)";"inproceedings"

The results of our Stack Overflow investigation show that its game mechanisms could be used to address these issues by motivating contributors to increase contribution frequency and quality, by filtering useful contributions, and by creating an agile and dependable moderation system. We proceed by mapping these mechanisms to open-source bug tracking systems, and find that most benefits are applicable.

Mockus";"Motivation: To survive and succeed, FLOSS projects need contributors able to accomplish critical project tasks. However, such tasks require extensive project experience of long term contributors (LTCs). Aim: We measure, understand, and predict how the newcomers' involvement and environment in the issue tracking system (ITS) affect their odds of becoming an LTC. Method: ITS data of Mozilla and Gnome, literature, interviews, and online documents were used to design measures of involvement and environment. A logistic regression model was used to explain and predict contributor's odds of becoming an LTC. We also reproduced the results on new data provided by Mozilla. Results: We constructed nine measures of involvement and environment based on events recorded in an ITS. Macro-climate is the overall project environment while micro-climate is person-specific and varies among the participants. Newcomers who are able to get at least one issue reported in the first month to be fixed, doubled their odds of becoming an LTC. The macro-climate with high project popularity and the micro-climate with low attention from peers reduced the odds. The precision of LTC prediction was 38 times higher than for a random predictor. We were able to reproduce the results with new Mozilla data without losing the significance or predictive power of the previously published model. We encountered unexpected changes in some attributes and suggest ways to make analysis of ITS data more reproducible. Conclusions: The findings suggest the importance of initial behaviors and experiences of new participants and outline empirically-based approaches to help the communities with the recruitment of contributors for long-term participation and to help the participants contribute more effectively.

But, to allocate an experienced member of a team to teach a newcomer during a long time is neither always possible nor desirable, because the mentor could be more helpful doing more important tasks. During the development the team interacts with a version control system, bug tracking and mailing lists, and all these tools record data creating the project memory. Recommender systems can use the project memory to help newcomers in some tasks answering their questions, thus in some cases the developers do not need a mentor. In this paper we present Mentor, a recommender system to help newcomers to solve change requests. Mentor uses the Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) algorithm and some heuristics to analyze the change requests, and the version control data, and recommend potentially relevant source code that will help the developer in the change request solution. We did three experiments to compare the PPM algorithm with the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Using PPM we achieved results for recall rate between 37% and 66.8%, and using LSI the results were between 20.3% and 51.6%.";"2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference";"inproceedings"

It was applied to the context of Bugzilla, the bug tracking system of Mozilla community. This study investigated the organizational aspects of this meditated, complex and highly distributed context through a linguistic analysis method. The main finding of this research shows that the organization of distributed problem-solving activities in Bugzilla isn't based only on the hierarchical distribution of the work between core and periphery participants but on their implication in the interactions. This implication varies according to the status of each one participant in the community. That is why we distinguish their roles, as well as, the established modes to manage such activity.";"IEEE 7th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)";"inproceedings"

Limiting factor to building the theory over thus accumulated knowledge is often related to dataset bias. One solution to this problem is developing a systematic data collection procedure through standard guidelines that would be available to open community and thus enable reducing data collection bias. In this paper we present a tool demonstration that implements a systematic data collection procedure for software defect prediction datasets from the open source bug tracking and the source code management repositories. Main challenging issue that the tool addresses is linking the information related to the same entity (e.g. class file) from these two sources.

Human collaboration inevitably evokes emotions like joy or sadness, which can affect the collaboration either positively or negatively, yet not much is known about the individual emotions and their role for software development stakeholders. In this study, we analyze whether development artifacts like issue reports carry any emotional information about software development. This is a first step towards verifying the feasibility of an automatic tool for emotion mining in software development artifacts: if humans cannot determine any emotion from a software artifact, neither can a tool. Analysis of the Apache Software Foundation issue tracking system shows that developers do express emotions (in particular gratitude, joy and sadness). However, the more context is provided about an issue report, the more human raters start to doubt and nuance their interpretation of emotions.

The students have to use an issue tracking software in combination with a Requirements Engineering (RE) tool to document and plan their work. Though the course starts with RE theory from elicitation via documentation and traceability, we found that the students find it difficult to combine different RE artifact types and to develop useful traces between them. In this paper we present an approach to provide feedback and give pro-active advice inside an RE tool, while the specification is created. To derive this feedback we use a knowledge base containing rules and best practices to create a requirements specification. An assistance system applies these rules to guide the user in different situations, beginning with an empty specification up to the implementation of various RE artifact types and traces between them. This paper presents the status of our knowledge-based feedback mechanism and possible extensions. In order to get primary indicators for the value of this approach we did experiments and workshops with eight students who worked with the same tool with and without the feedback system.";"Requirements Engineering Education and Training (REET), 2012 IEEE 7th International Workshop on";"inproceedings"

In particular, users would use the application normally and report bugs that they encounter to prevent anyone - including themselves - from encountering those bugs again. When a user attempts an action that has led to problems in the past, he/she will receive a warning and will be given the opportunity to abort the action thus avoiding the bug altogether and keeping the application stable. Of course, bugs should be fixed eventually by the application developers, but our approach allows application users to collaboratively help each other avoid bugs - thus making the application more usable in the meantime.

Private clouds play an important role in this new service delivery model being designed to provide computing capacity within the organization premises either standalone or in a hybrid model. As resources of the private cloud are limited, QoS assurance becomes an important challenge. This paper presents the design of a monitoring solution that integrates several open source tools and can assure QoS for private clouds. The solution is implemented for IBM CloudBurst 2.1 and IBM TSAM product stack and can monitor a wide range of services, from CPU and memory load to J2EE services and HTTP statistics generate real time alerts and provide integration with a Jira based issue tracking tools.

In this work, we propose a new approach for assignee recommendation leveraging user activities in a bug tracking repository. Within the bug tracking repository, an activity profile is created for each user from the history of all his activities (i.e. review, assign, and resolve). This profile, to some extent, indicates the user's role, expertise, and involvement in this project. These activities influence and contribute to the identification and ranking of suitable assignees. In order to evaluate our work, we apply it to bug reports of three different projects. Our results indicate that the proposed approach is able to achieve an average hit ratio of 88%. Comparing this result to the LDA-SVM - based assignee recommendation technique, it was found that the proposed approach performs better.";"Mining Software Repositories (MSR), 2013 10th IEEE Working Conference on";"inproceedings"

However, all too often the data stored in issue tracking repositories is not explicitly tagged or linked to source code. Researchers have to resort to heuristics to tag the data (e.g., to determine if an issue is a bug report or a work item), or to link a piece of code to a particular issue or bug. Recent studies by Bird et al. and by Antoniol et al. suggest that software models based on imperfect datasets with missing links to the code and incorrect tagging of issues, exhibit biases that compromise the validity and generality of the quality models built on top of the datasets. In this study, we verify the effects of such biases for a commercial project that enforces strict development guidelines and rules on the quality of the data in its issue tracking repository. Our results show that even in such a perfect setting, with a near-ideal dataset, biases do exist - leading us to conjecture that biases are more likely a symptom of the underlying software development process instead of being due to the used heuristics.";"2010 17th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering";"inproceedings"

Unfortunately, web applications are prone to JavaScript faults. While prior studies have demonstrated the prevalence of these faults, no attempts have been made to determine their root causes and consequences. Objective: The goal of our study is to understand the root causes and impact of JavaScript faults and how the results can impact JavaScript programmers, testers and tool developers. Method: We perform an empirical study of 317 bug reports from 12 bug repositories. The bug reports are thoroughly examined to classify and extract information about the fault's cause (the error) and consequence (the failure and impact). Result: The majority (65%) of JavaScript faults are DOM-related, meaning they are caused by faulty interactions of the JavaScript code with the Document Object Model (DOM). Further, 80% of the highest impact JavaScript faults are DOM-related. Finally, most JavaScript faults originate from programmer mistakes committed in the JavaScript code itself, as opposed to other web application components such as the server-side or HTML code. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of DOM-related faults, JavaScript programmers need development tools that can help them reason about the DOM. Also, testers should prioritize detection of DOM-related faults as most high impact faults belong to this category. Finally, developers can use the error patterns we found to design more powerful static analysis tools for JavaScript. © 2013 IEEE.";"";"conference"

Allowing anyone to contribute finding and reporting faults has an immediate impact on software quality. However, this benefit comes with at least one side-effect. Users often file reports that describe the same fault. This increases the maintainer's triage time, but important information required to fix the fault is likely contributed by different reports. Aim: The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we want to understand the dynamics of bug report filing for a large, long duration open source project, Firefox. Second, we present a new approach that can reduce the number of duplicate reports. Method: The novel element in the proposed approach is the ability to concentrate the search for duplicates on specific portions of the bug repository. Our system can be deployed as a search tool to help reporters query the repository. Results: When tested as a search tool our system is able to detect up to 53% of duplicate reports. Conclusion: The performance of Information Retrieval techniques can be significantly improved by guiding the search for duplicates.

This paper proposes a search-based test data generation approach aimed at automatically identify NPEs. The approach consists of two steps: (i) an inter-procedural data and control flow analysis - relying on existing technology - that identifies paths between input parameters and potential NPEs, and (ii) a genetic algorithm that evolves a population of test data with the aim of covering such paths. The algorithm is able to deal with complex inputs containing arbitrary data structures. The approach has been evaluated on to test class clusters from six Java open source systems, where NPE bugs have been artificially introduced. Results show that the approach is, indeed, able to identify the NPE bugs, and it outperforms random testing.

"Saha2015";"ARE THESE BUGS REALLY 'NORMAL'?";"Saha, R.K.a and Lawall, J.b and Khurshid, S.a and Perry, D.E.a ";"Understanding the severity of reported bugs is important in both research and practice. In particular, a number of recently proposed mining-based software engineering techniques predict bug severity, bug report quality, and bug-fix time, according to this information. Many bug tracking systems provide a field 'severity' offering options such as 'severe', 'normal', and 'minor', with 'normal' as the default. However, there is a widespread perception that for many bug reports the label 'normal' may not reflect the actual severity, because reporters may overlook setting the severity or may not feel confident enough to do so. In many cases, researchers ignore 'normal' bug reports, and thus overlook a large percentage of the reports provided. On the other hand, treating them all together risks mixing reports that have very diverse properties. In this study, we investigate the extent to which 'normal' bug reports actually have the 'normal' severity. We find that many 'normal' bug reports in practice are not normal.

As a step in the bug triaging process, assigning a new bug to the most appropriate developer to fix it, is not only a time-consuming and tedious task. The triager, the person who considers a bug and assigns it to a developer, also needs to be aware of developer activities at different parts of the project. It is clear that only a few developers have this ability to carry out this step of bug triaging. The main goal of this paper is to suggest a new approach to the process of performing automatic bug assignment. The information needed to select the best developers to fix a new bug report is extracted from the version control repository of the project. Unlike all the previous suggested approaches which used Machine Learning and Information Retrieval methods, this research employs the Information Extraction (IE) methods to extract the information from the software repositories. The proposed approach does not use the information of the bug repository to make decisions about bugs in order to obtain better results on projects which do not have many fixed bugs. The aim of this research is to recommend the actual fixers of the bugs. Using this approach, we achieved 62%, 43% and 41% accuracies on Eclipse, Mozilla and Gnome projects, respectively.";"Advanced Computer Science Applications and Technologies (ACSAT), 2012 International Conference on";"inproceedings"

However, testing code is just as likely to contain bugs as the code it tests. Buggy test cases can silently miss bugs in the production code or loudly ring false alarms when the production code is correct. We present the first empirical study of bugs in test code to characterize their prevalence and root cause categories. We mine the bug repositories and version control systems of 211 Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects and find 5,556 test-related bug reports. We (1) compare properties of test bugs with production bugs, such as active time and fixing effort needed, and (2) qualitatively study 443 randomly sampled test bug reports in detail and categorize them based on their impact and root causes. Our results show that (1) around half of all the projects had bugs in their test code; (2) the majority of test bugs are false alarms, i.e., test fails while the production code is correct, while a minority of these bugs result in silent horrors, i.e., test passes while the production code is incorrect; (3) incorrect and missing assertions are the dominant root cause of silent horror bugs; (4) semantic (25%), flaky (21%), environment-related (18%) bugs are the dominant root cause categories of false alarms; (5) the majority of false alarm bugs happen in the exercise portion of the tests, and (6) developers contribute more actively to fixing test bugs and test bugs are fixed sooner compared to production bugs.

Empirical software engineering researchers can mine the artifacts from these tools to better understand how FLOSS is made. As the landscape of distributed software development has grown and changed, the tools needed to make FLOSS have changed as well. There are three newer tools at the center of FLOSS development today: distributed version control based forges (like Github), programmer question-and-answer communities (like Stack Overflow), and paste bin tools (like Gist or Pastebin.com). These tools are extending and changing the toolset used for FLOSS development, and redefining what a software forge looks like.

"Stepalin2010";"SAAS SUPPORT IN SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEMS";"E. Stepalina";"In recent days more and more software developments tools become distributed by the SaaS (Software-As-A Service) model alongside with ready-to-install products. The developers of task and bug tracking systems now offer their solutions by a monthly fee. For instance, JIRA Studio produced by Atlassian can be connected to a corporative domain by subscription. This scheme allows software companies to reduce costs at the project's start and get scalable resources in future. Software documentation systems can also be purchased by a subscription now. The effectiveness of their usage for various documentation development is interesting. There are four major types of documentation supporting the development process and resulted products: project, technical, code and user documentation. Each of this type claims specific requirements for the documentation tool. The requirement analysis shows that rented documentation systems are the most appropriate for user and technical documentation. There are two major classes of software documentation systems: 1) Wiki, 2) DITA-orientedXML CMS. The following wiki systems have a hosted version: commercial Confluence, Central Desktop, EditMe, Incentive, Netcipia, PBWiki, Wikia, Wikispaces; open source BusinessWiki, Metadot Wiki, MindTouch, Wagn, Wikidot. The richest by the functionality andplugin collection is Confluence produced by Atlassian. The following XML CMS are offered by a SaaS model (all are commercial): Astoria On Demand, DITA Exchange. DocZone. SaaS is optionally supported in Bluestream XDocs, Siberlogic SiberSafe, Trisoft Infoshare, Vasont, X-Hive Docato. As wiki system is a ready integrated environment for creating and publishing documentation, DITA-system consists not only of XML CMS. To deploy a DITA-system, you should have an XML editor, publisher and CMS. The listed CMS can be integrated with top DITA XML editors and provide an API to integrate with other editors. These CMS also have build-in tools to export documents in mu- - ltiple formats. However, the universal component architecture of DITA-systems makes the deployment and configuration more difficult than wiki implementation. Hosted documentation systems are offered by different prices. The offerings of top documentation systems are considered in this paper. Wiki subscription fees range from 4,95$ (EditMe) to 20$ (Confluence) per one user/month. XML CMS subscription price starts from 500$ per month and can reach 12000$ per month. These subscriptions have no fixed price; in each individual case the CMS vendor performs a specific project of a DITA-system implementation. Wiki rental costs approximate to CMS subscriptions' costs for large number of users, 500 and more. The advantages of renting a powerful documentation system for small and large project are the following: 1) Maximal functionality at a low affordable cost, 2) Platform independency and high system accessibility, 3) Document quality improvement at the expense of quality controlling tools application, 4) Higher effectiveness of documentation (content re-use, single source usage, automated tools for localization), 5) Organization of robust and scalable documentation process. As the SaaS business model becomes more popular, small companies get access to powerful software documentation systems, which are too expensive to purchase a standalone license at the startup. However, the system's access security, reliability and information confidentiality issues remain opened and controversial.";"Software Engineering Conference (CEE-SECR), 2010 6th Central and Eastern European";"inproceedings"

Jiang";"In a bug tracking system, different testers or users may submit multiple reports on the same bugs, referred to as duplicates, which may cost extra maintenance efforts in triaging and fixing bugs. In order to identify such duplicates accurately, in this paper we propose a retrieval function (REP) to measure the similarity between two bug reports. It fully utilizes the information available in a bug report including not only the similarity of textual content in summary and description fields, but also similarity of non-textual fields such as product, component, version, etc. For more accurate measurement of textual similarity, we extend BM25F - an effective similarity formula in information retrieval community, specially for duplicate report retrieval. Lastly we use a two-round stochastic gradient descent to automatically optimize REP for specific bug repositories in a supervised learning manner. We have validated our technique on three large software bug repositories from Mozilla, Eclipse and OpenOffice. The experiments show 10-27% relative improvement in recall rate@k and 17-23% relative improvement in mean average precision over our previous model. We also applied our technique to a very large dataset consisting of 209,058 reports from Eclipse, resulting in a recall rate@k of 37-71% and mean average precision of 47%.";"Automated Software Engineering (ASE), 2011 26th IEEE/ACM International Conference on";"inproceedings"

Bug update information managed by bug tracking systems (BTS) is one of text stream data, which continuously generates new data. Therefore, it is difficult for users to watch it all the time. In other words, the task of monitoring stream data inevitably involves breaks of the task, which would lose the context of monitoring. However, to the best of our knowledge, interaction design when involving breaks has not been fully studied yet. The proposed system visualizes the dynamic relationship between bugs with animation, and helps a user grasping the context of monitoring by highlighting updated bugs and the replay of animation for part of the last monitoring time. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated through experiments with test participants. Recent growth of the Web has brought us various kinds of text stream data, such as bulletin board systems (BBS), blogs, and social networking services (SNS). As such data is expected to be important resources for human support robots, this paper would contribute to interaction design of such robots.";"Industrial Electronics (ISIE), 2013 IEEE International Symposium on";"inproceedings"

"Thung2014";"DUPFINDER: INTEGRATED TOOL SUPPORT FOR DUPLICATE BUG REPORT DETECTION";"Thung, F. and Kochhar, P.S. and Lo, D.";"To track bugs that appear in a software, developers often make use of a bug tracking system. Users can report bugs that they encounter in such a system. Bug reporting is inherently an uncoordinated distributed process though and thus when a user submits a new bug report, there might be cases when another bug report describing exactly the same problem is already present in the system. Such bug reports are duplicate of each other and these duplicate bug reports need to be identified. A number of past studies have proposed a number of automated approaches to detect duplicate bug reports. However, these approaches are not integrated to existing bug tracking systems. In this paper, we propose a tool named DupFinder, which implements the state-of-theart unsupervised duplicate bug report approach by Runeson et al., as a Bugzilla extension. DupFinder does not require any training data and thus can easily be deployed to any project. DupFinder extracts texts from summary and description fields of a new bug report and recent bug reports present in a bug tracking system, uses vector space model to measure similarity of bug reports, and provides developers with a list of potential duplicate bug reports based on the similarity of these reports with the new bug report.

"Thung2013";"AUTOMATIC RECOVERY OF ROOT CAUSES FROM BUG-FIXING CHANGES";"F. Thung and D. Lo and L. Jiang";"What is the root cause of this failure? This question is often among the first few asked by software debuggers when they try to address issues raised by a bug report. Root cause is the erroneous lines of code that cause a chain of erroneous program states eventually leading to the failure. Bug tracking and source control systems only record the symptoms (e.g., bug reports) and treatments of a bug (e.g., committed changes that fix the bug), but not its root cause. Many treatments contain non-essential changes, which are intermingled with root causes. Reverse engineering the root cause of a bug can help to understand why the bug is introduced and help to detect and prevent other bugs of similar causes. The recovered root causes are also better ground truth for bug detection and localization studies. In this work, we propose a combination of machine learning and code analysis techniques to identify root causes from the changes made to fix bugs. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach based on a golden set (i.e., ground truth data) of manually recovered root causes of 200 bug reports from three open source projects. Our approach is able to achieve a precision, recall, and F-measure (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 76.42%, 71.88%, and 74.08% respectively.

We refer to the period of time between the time when a bug is introduced into code and the time when it is reported by a user as bug reporting latency. Knowledge of bug reporting latencies has an implication on prioritization of bug fixing activities-bugs with low reporting latencies may be fixed earlier than those with high latencies to shift debugging resources towards bugs highly concerning users. To investigate bug reporting latencies, we analyze bugs from three Java software systems: AspectJ, Rhino, and Lucene. We extract bug reporting data from their version control repositories and bug tracking systems, identify bug locations based on bug fixes, and back-trace bug introducing time based on change histories of the buggy code. Also, we remove non-essential changes, and most importantly, recover root causes of bugs from their treatments/fixes. We then calculate the bug reporting latencies, and find that bugs have diverse reporting latencies. Based on the calculated reporting latencies and features we extract from bugs, we build classification models that can predict whether a bug would be reported early (within 30 days) or later, which may be helpful for prioritizing bug fixing activities. Our evaluation on the three software systems shows that our bug reporting latency prediction models could achieve an AUC (Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics Curve) of 70.869%.";"Software Maintenance (ICSM), 2012 28th IEEE International Conference on";"inproceedings"

To improve the reliability of software systems, developers often allow end users to provide feedback on bugs that they encounter. Users could perform this by sending a bug report in a bug report management system like Bugzilla. This process however is uncoordinated and distributed, which means that many users could submit bug reports reporting the same problem. These are referred to as duplicate bug reports. The existence of many duplicate bug reports may cause much unnecessary manual efforts as often a triager would need to manually tag bug reports as being duplicates. Recently, there have been a number of studies that investigate duplicate bug report problem which in effect answer the following question: given a new bug report, retrieve k other similar bug reports. This, however, still requires substantive manual effort which could be reduced further. Jalbert and Weimer are the first to introduce the direct detection of duplicate bug reports; it answers the question: given a new bug report, classify if it as a duplicate bug report or not.

However, non-trivial events never decrease on large systems, such as cloud computing systems, while investigating events is time consuming.

The approach aims to build a decision tree based on the features of old events, then use this tree to decide the severity level of new events. The administrators take advantages of this decision to determine proper actions for the non-trivial events.

Triaging bugs can become a laborious task particularly in open source software (OSS) projects with a large base of comparably inexperienced part-time contributors. In this paper, we propose an efficient and practical method to identify valid bug reports which a) refer to an actual software bug, b) are not duplicates and c) contain enough information to be processed right away. Our classification is based on nine measures to quantify the social embeddedness of bug reporters in the collaboration network. We demonstrate its applicability in a case study, using a comprehensive data set of more than 700, 000 bug reports obtained from the Bugzilla installation of four major OSS communities, for a period of more than ten years. For those projects that exhibit the lowest fraction of valid bug reports, we find that the bug reporters' position in the collaboration network is a strong indicator for the quality of bug reports. Based on this finding, we develop an automated classification scheme that can easily be integrated into bug tracking platforms and analyze its performance in the considered OSS communities. A support vector machine (SVM) to identify valid bug reports based on the nine measures yields a precision of up to 90.3% with an associated recall of 38.9%. With this, we significantly improve the results obtained in previous case studies for an automated early identification of bugs that are eventually fixed. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of using quantitative measures of social organization in collaborative software engineering.

Hallé";"Runtime verification is the process of observing a sequence of events generated by a running system and comparing it to some formal specification for potential violations. We show how the use of a runtime monitor can greatly speed up the testing phase of a video game under development, by automating the detection of bugs when the game is being played. We take advantage of the fact that a video game, contrarily to generic software, follows a special structure that contains a \""game loop\"", this game loop can be used to centralize the instrumentation and generate events based on the game's internal state. We report on experiments made on a sample of five real-world video games of various genres and sizes, by successfully incrementing and efficiently monitoring various temporal properties over their execution-including actual bugs reported in the games' bug tracking database in the course of their development.";"2014 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation";"inproceedings"

Among various ways to estimate the effort, analysis of bug report attributes proved excellent results. In this paper the effort required to fix the bug on the components of Firefox application is studied. A framework has been charted for analysing the feature attributes which on imparting association rule mining process resulted with dictating rules which provide the effort succumb to fix the bugs of a particular component. The bug reports used for this study are extracted from Bugzilla, an open source bug repository. These bug reports provides a variety of categorical data from previous projects.

Carroll";"Open source is an important model of collaborative knowledge work and virtual organizations. One of its work practices, peer review, is considered critical to its success, as Linus's law highlights. Thus, understanding open source peer review, particular effective review practices, will improve the understanding of how to support collaborative work in new ways. Therefore, we conduct case studies in two open source communities that are well recognized as effective and successful, Mozilla and Python. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of our analysis on data from the bug tracking systems of those two organizations. We identify four common activities critical to open source software peer review, submission, identification, resolution and evaluation. Differences between communities indicate factors, such as reporter expertise, product type and structure, and organization size, affect review activities. We also discuss features of open source software peer review distinct from traditional review, as well as reconsiderations of Linus's law.";"Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS), 2011 International Conference on";"inproceedings"

However, finding an appropriate bug and an appropriate fix for that bug requires a good understanding of the project, which is nontrivial. Here, we extend Tesseract - an interactive project exploration environment - to allow new developers to search over bug descriptions in a project to quickly identify and explore bugs of interest and their related resources. More specifically, we extended Tesseract with search capabilities that enable synonyms and similar-bugs search over bug descriptions in a bug repository. The goal is to enable users to identify bugs of interest, resources related to that bug, (e.g., related files, contributing developers, communication records), and visually explore the appropriate socio-technical dependencies for the selected bug in an interactive manner.

Gall";"Historical data about software projects is stored in repositories such as version control, bug tracking and mailing lists. Analyzing such data is vital to discover unthought-of-yet-interesting insights of a software project. Even though a wide range of software analysis techniques are already available, integration of such analyses is yet to be systematically addressed. Inspired from the recently introduced concept of Software as a Service, our research group investigated the concept of Software Analysis as a Service (SOFAS), a distributed and collaborative software analysis platform. SOFAS allows software analyses to be accessed, composed into workflows, and executed over the Internet. However, traditional service composition is a complex, time consuming and error-prone process, which requires experts in both composition languages and existing standards. In this paper, we propose a mashup platform to address the problem of software analysis composition in a light-weight, programming-free process-centric way. Our proposed mashup platform provides design-time guidance to the users throughout the mashup design by integrating a continuous feedback mechanism. It requires exploiting semantic web technologies and Software Engineering Ontologies (SEON).";"2012 19th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference";"inproceedings"

In this paper, we present BugMiner, a tool that is able to derive useful information from historic bug report database using data mining, use these information to do completion check and redundancy check on a new or given bug report, and to estimate the bug report trend using statistical analysis. Our empirical studies of the tool using several real-world bug report repositories show that it is effective, easy to implement, and has relatively high accuracy despite low quality data.";"";"conference"

We collect Mozilla Fire fox open bug repository as the experimental data set and compare different ranking metrics on the performance of recommending capable developers for bugs. Our experimental results demonstrate that, when recommending 10 developers for each one of the 250 testing bugs, DREX has produced better performance than traditional methods with multi-labeled text categorization. The best performance obtained by two metrics as Out-Degree and Frequency, is with recall as 0.6 on average. Moreover, other social network metrics such as Degree and Page Rank have produced comparable performance on developer recommendation as Frequency when used for developer expertise ranking.";"2011 18th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference";"inproceedings"

Using issue tracking data and interviews with experienced contributors we investigate ways to quantify the impact of triagers on reducing the number of issues developers need to resolve in two OSS projects: Mozilla and Gnome. We find the primary impact of triagers to involve issue filtering, filling missing information, and determining the relevant product. While triagers were good at filtering invalid issues and as accurate as developers in filling in missing issue attributes, they had more difficulty accurately pinpointing the relevant product. We expect that this work will highlight the importance of issue triage in software projects and will help design further studies on understanding and improving triage practices.";"2013 ACM / IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement";"inproceedings"

Zhang";"During software evolution, new released versions still contain many bugs. One common scenario is that end users encounter regression faults and submit them to bug tracking systems. Different from in-house regression testing, typically only one test input is available, which passes the old version and fails the modified new version. To address the issue, delta debugging has been proposed for failure-inducing changes identification between two versions. Despite promising results, there are two practical factors that thwart the application of delta debugging: a large number of tests and misleading false positives. In this work, we present a combination of coverage analysis and delta debugging that automatically isolates failure-inducing changes. Evaluations on twelve real regression faults in GNU software demonstrate both the speed gain and effectiveness improvements. Moreover, a case study on libPNG and TCPflow indicates that our technique is comparable to peer techniques in debugging regressions faults.";"Automated Software Engineering (ASE), 2012 Proceedings of the 27th IEEE/ACM International Conference on";"inproceedings"

In this paper, we provide a quantitative analysis of the relation between social organization and performance in Gentoo, an Open Source community developing a Linux distribution. We study the structure and dynamics of collaborations as recorded in the project's bug tracking system over a period of ten years. We identify a period of increasing centralization after which most interactions in the community were mediated by a single central contributor. In this period of maximum centralization, the central contributor unexpectedly left the project, thus posing a significant challenge for the community. We quantify how the rise, the activity as well as the subsequent sudden dropout of this central contributor affected both the social organization and the bug handling performance of the Gentoo community. We analyze social organization from the perspective of network theory and augment our quantitative findings by interviews with prominent members of the Gentoo community which shared their personal insights.";"Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE), 2013 6th International Workshop on";"inproceedings"
"Zhang2014a";"A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR DUPLICATE DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF BUG REPORTS";"Zhang, T. and Lee, B.";"Software products are increasingly complex, so it is becoming more difficult to find and correct bugs in large programs. Software developers rely on bug reports to fix bugs; thus, bug-tracking tools have been introduced to allow developers to upload, manage, and comment on bug reports to guide corrective software maintenance. However, the very high frequency of duplicate bug reports means that the triagers who help software developers in eliminating bugs must allocate large amounts of time and effort to the identification and analysis of these bug reports. In addition, classifying bug reports can help triagers arrange bugs in categories for the fixers who have more experience for resolving historical bugs in the same category. Unfortunately, due to a large number of submitted bug reports every day, the manual classification for these bug reports increases the triagers' workload. To resolve these problems, in this study, we develop a novel technique for automatic duplicate detection and classification of bug reports, which reduces the time and effort consumed by triagers for bug fixing. Our novel technique uses a support vector machine to check whether a new bug report is a duplicate. The concept profile is also used to classify the bug reports into related categories in a taxonomic tree. Finally, we conduct experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach using bug reports extracted from the large-scale open source project Mozilla.

With increasing number of bug reports submitted to the bug tracking system, it is more and more difficult to assign appropriate developers to all the reported bugs manually. In this paper, we propose an approach called BUTTER (BUg Triage by topic modeling and heTERogeneous network analysis) to automatically assign bugs to developers. Different from other work, we regard that in most cases, bug resolution is a collaborative activity which involves many developers' participation. Although social network analysis has been introduced to characterize the collaboration of developers, networks constructed by researchers are usually homogenous. That is, all the nodes and links in these networks are regarded as having same properties. Considering developers collaborated on different bugs, we construct a heterogeneous network that includes relationships between submitters, bugs and developers to characterize developers' collaboration. Experiment shows that BUTTER outperforms other methods on automated bug triage.";"Cloud Computing and Big Data (CCBD), 2014 International Conference on";"inproceedings"

Zimmermann";"Software development results in a huge amount of data: changes to source code are recorded in version archives, bugs are reported to issue tracking systems, and communications are archived in e-mails and newsgroups. We present techniques for mining version archives and bug databases to understand and support software development. First, we introduce the concept of co-addition of method calls, which we use to identify patterns that describe how methods should be called. We use dynamic analysis to validate these patterns and identify violations. The co-addition of method calls can also detect cross-cutting changes, which are an indicator for concerns that could have been realized as aspects in aspect-oriented programming. Second, we present techniques to build models that can successfully predict the most defect-prone parts of large-scale industrial software, in our experiments Windows Server 2003. This helps managers to allocate resources for quality assurance to those parts of a system that are expected to have most defects. The proposed measures on dependency graphs outperformed traditional complexity metrics. In addition, we found empirical evidence for a domino effect, i.e., depending on defect-prone binaries increases the chances of having defects.";"Software Maintenance, 2009. ICSM 2009.

"Zou2015";"AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF BUG FIXING RATE";"W. Zou and X. Xia and W. Zhang and Z. Chen and D. Lo";"Bug fixing is one of the most important activities in software development and maintenance. A software project often employs an issue tracking system such as Bugzilla to store and manage their bugs. In the issue tracking system, many bugs are invalid but take unnecessary efforts to identify them. In this paper, we mainly focus on bug fixing rate, i.e., The proportion of the fixed bugs in the reported closed bugs. In particular, we study the characteristics of bug fixing rate and investigate the impact of a reporter's different contribution behaviors to the bug fixing rate. We perform an empirical study on all reported bugs of two large open source software communities Eclipse and Mozilla. We find (1) the bug fixing rates of both projects are not high, (2) there exhibits a negative correlation between a reporter's bug fixing rate and the average time cost to close the bugs he/she reports, (3) the amount of bugs a reporter ever fixed has a strong positive impact on his/her bug fixing rate, (4) reporters' bug fixing rates have no big difference, whether their contribution behaviors concentrate on a few products or across many products, (5) reporters' bug fixing rates tend to increase as time goes on, i.e., Developers become more experienced at reporting bugs.";"Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC), 2015 IEEE 39th Annual";"inproceedings"
