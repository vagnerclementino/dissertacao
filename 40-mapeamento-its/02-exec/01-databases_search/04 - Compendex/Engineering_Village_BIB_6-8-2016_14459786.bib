abstract = {To track bugs that appear in a software, developers often make use of a bug tracking system. Users can report bugs that they encounter in such a system. Bug reporting is inherently an uncoordinated distributed process though and thus when a user submits a new bug report, there might be cases when another bug report describing exactly the same problem is already present in the system. Such bug reports are duplicate of each other and these duplicate bug reports need to be identified. A number of past studies have proposed a number of automated approaches to detect duplicate bug reports. However, these approaches are not integrated to existing bug tracking systems. In this paper, we propose a tool named DupFinder, which implements the state-of-theart unsupervised duplicate bug report approach by Runeson et al., as a Bugzilla extension. DupFinder does not require any training data and thus can easily be deployed to any project. DupFinder extracts texts from summary and description fields of a new bug report and recent bug reports present in a bug tracking system, uses vector space model to measure similarity of bug reports, and provides developers with a list of potential duplicate bug reports based on the similarity of these reports with the new bug report. We have released DupFinder as an open source tool in GitHub, which is available at: uhttps://github.com/smagsmu/dupfinder. &copy; 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {Bugs are prevalent in software systems. To improve the reliability of software systems, developers often allow end users to provide feedback on bugs that they encounter. Users could perform this by sending a bug report in a bug report management system like Bugzilla. This process however is uncoordinated and distributed, which means that many users could submit bug reports reporting the same problem. These are referred to as duplicate bug reports. The existence of many duplicate bug reports may cause much unnecessary manual efforts as often a triager would need to manually tag bug reports as being duplicates. Recently, there have been a number of studies that investigate duplicate bug report problem which in effect answer the following question: given a new bug report, retrieve k other similar bug reports. This, however, still requires substantive manual effort which could be reduced further. Jalbert and Weimer are the first to introduce the direct detection of duplicate bug reports; it answers the question: given a new bug report, classify if it as a duplicate bug report or not. In this paper, we extend Jalbert and Weimer's work by improving the accuracy of automated duplicate bug report identification. We experiments with bug reports from Mozilla bug tracking system which were reported between February 2005 to October 2005, and find that we could improve the accuracy of the previous approach by about 160%. &copy; 2012 IEEE.},

This work proposes to address these issues by applying game mechanisms to bug tracking systems. We investigate the use of game mechanisms in Stack Overflow, an online community organized to resolve computer programming related problems, for which the improvements we seek for bug tracking systems also turn out to be relevant. The results of our Stack Overflow investigation show that its game mechanisms could be used to address these issues by motivating contributors to increase contribution frequency and quality, by filtering useful contributions, and by creating an agile and dependable moderation system. We proceed by mapping these mechanisms to open-source bug tracking systems, and find that most benefits are applicable. Additionally, our results motivate tailoring a reward and reputation system and summarizing bug reports as future directions for increasing the benefits of game mechanisms in bug tracking systems. &copy; 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Most of large web-based development communities require a bug tracking system to keep track of various bug reports. However, duplicate bug reports tend to result in waste of resources, and may cause potential conflicts. There have been two types of works focusing on this problem: relevant bug report retrieval [8][11][10][13] and duplicate bug report identification [5][12]. The former methods can achieve high accuracy (82%) in the top 10 results in some dataset, but they do not really reduce the workload of developers. The latter methods still need further improvement on the performance. In this paper, we propose a practical duplicate bug reports detection method, which aims to help project team to reduce their workload by combining existing two categories of methods. We also propose some new features extracted from comments, user profiles and query feedback, which are useful for improving the detection performance. Experiments on real dataset show that our method improves the accuracy rate by 23% compared to state-of-the-art work in duplicate bug report identification, and improves the recall rate by up to 8% in relevant bug report retrieval. &copy; 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Background: Bug Tracking Repositories, such as Bugzilla, are designed to support fault reporting for developers, testers and users of the system. Allowing anyone to contribute finding and reporting faults has an immediate impact on software quality. However, this benefit comes with at least one side-effect. Users often file reports that describe the same fault. This increases the maintainer's triage time, but important information required to fix the fault is likely contributed by different reports. Aim: The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we want to understand the dynamics of bug report filing for a large, long duration open source project, Firefox. Second, we present a new approach that can reduce the number of duplicate reports. Method: The novel element in the proposed approach is the ability to concentrate the search for duplicates on specific portions of the bug repository. Our system can be deployed as a search tool to help reporters query the repository. Results: When tested as a search tool our system is able to detect up to 53% of duplicate reports. Conclusion: The performance of Information Retrieval techniques can be significantly improved by guiding the search for duplicates. This approach results in higher detection rates and constant classification runtime. Copyright &copy; 2011 ACM.},

Once the Bug is reported on Bug Tracking System, their attributes are analyzed and subsequently assigned to various fixers for their resolution. During the last two decades Machine-Learning Techniques (MLT) has been used to create self-improving software. Supervised machine learning technique is widely used for prediction of patterns in various applications but, we have found very few for software repositories. Bug severity, an attribute of a software bug report is the degree of impact that a defect has on the development or operation of a component or system. Bug severity can be classified into different levels based on their impact on the system. In this paper, an attempt has been made to demonstrate the applicability of machine learning algorithms namely Nai&die;ve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, Nai&die;ve Bayes Multinomial, Support Vector Machine, J48 and RIPPER in determining the class of bug severity of bug report data of NASA from PROMISE repository.

Finally the bug triager checks the bug report and typically assigns a developer to fix the bug. The assignment process is time-consuming and error-prone. Furthermore, a large number of bug reports are tossed (reassigned) to other developers, which increases bug-fix time. In order to quickly identify the fixer to bug reports we present an approach based on the bug tossing history and textual similarities between bug reports. This proposed approach is evaluated on Eclipse and Mozilla. The results show that our approach can significantly improve the efficiency of bug assignment: the bug fixer is often identified with fewer tossing events. &copy; 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract = {Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) cube is a multi-dimensional dataset used for analyzing data in a Data Warehouse (DW) for the purpose of extracting actionable intelligence. Process mining consists of analyzing event log data produced from Process Aware Information Systems (PAIS) for the purpose of discovering and improving business processes. Process cube is a concept which falls at the intersection of OLAP cube and process mining. Process cube facilitates process mining from multiple-dimensions and enables comparison of process mining results across various dimensions. We present an application of process cube to software defect resolution process to analyze and compare process data from a multi-dimensional perspective. We present a framework, a novel perspective to mine software repositories using process cube. Each cell of process cube is defined by metrics from multiple process mining perspectives like control flow, time, conformance and organizational perspective. We conduct a case-study on Google Chromium project data in which the software defect resolution process spans three software repositories: Issue Tracking System (ITS), Peer Code Review System (PCR) and Version Control System (VCS). We define process cube with 9 dimensions as issue report timestamp, priority, state, closed status, OS, component, bug type, reporter and owner. We define hierarchies along various dimensions and cluster members to handle sparsity. We apply OLAP cube operations such as slice, dice, roll-up and drill-down, and create materialized sublog for each cell. We demonstrate the solution approach by discovering process map and compare process mining results from control flow and time perspective for Performance and Security issues. &copy; 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {A typical entry point for new developers in an open source project is to contribute a bug fix. However, finding an appropriate bug and an appropriate fix for that bug requires a good understanding of the project, which is nontrivial. Here, we extend Tesseract - an interactive project exploration environment - to allow new developers to search over bug descriptions in a project to quickly identify and explore bugs of interest and their related resources. More specifically, we extended Tesseract with search capabilities that enable synonyms and similar-bugs search over bug descriptions in a bug repository. The goal is to enable users to identify bugs of interest, resources related to that bug, (e.g., related files, contributing developers, communication records), and visually explore the appropriate socio-technical dependencies for the selected bug in an interactive manner. Here we present our search extension to Tesseract. &copy; 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Software development is a collaborative activity in which developers interact to create and maintain a complex software system. Human collaboration inevitably evokes emotions like joy or sadness, which can affect the collaboration either positively or negatively, yet not much is known about the individual emotions and their role for software development stakeholders. In this study, we analyze whether development artifacts like issue reports carry any emotional information about software development. This is a first step towards verifying the feasibility of an automatic tool for emotion mining in software development artifacts: if humans cannot determine any emotion from a software artifact, neither can a tool. Analysis of the Apache Software Foundation issue tracking system shows that developers do express emotions (in particular gratitude, joy and sadness). However, the more context is provided about an issue report, the more human raters start to doubt and nuance their interpretation of emotions. More investigation is needed before building a fully automatic emotion mining tool. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

abstract = {Traceability links can be recovered using data mined from a revision control system, such as CVS, and an issue tracking system, such as Bugzilla. Existing approaches to recover links between a bug and the methods changed to fix the bug rely on the presence of the bug's identifier in a CVS log message. In this paper we present an approach that relies instead on the presence of a patch in the issue report for the bug. That is, rather than analyzing deltas retrieved from CVS to recover links, our approach analyzes patches retrieved from Bugzilla. We use BugTrace, the tool implementing our approach, to conduct a case study in which we compare the links recovered by our approach to links recovered by manual inspection. The results of the case study support the efficacy of our approach. After describing the limitations of our case study, we conclude by reviewing closely related work and suggesting possible future work. &copy; 2011 ACM.},
